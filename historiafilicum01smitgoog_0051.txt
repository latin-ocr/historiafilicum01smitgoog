sporangiferous receptacle, differences which, with two or
three exceptione, appear to me to be more useful as specific
than as generic characters ; indeed, in some cases they are
so trifling that I have failed to find them. Under these
circumstances I cannot see that any practical advantage
will be gained by dividing Hymenophyllaceoe into so many
genera as Presl has done.

Hymenophyllaoeae also form the subject of a special mono-
gmph, published in 1858 by Dr. Van den Bosch, of GoeS,
Holland. It consiste of seventy-nine pages octavo, and is
entitled “ Synopsis Hymenophyllacearum‚ Monographiae
hujus ordinis Prodromus.” It contains simply an enu-
meration of names of genera and species with references to
authors. He enumeratos no less than 305 specieS, being
120 above that of Presl‚ and 156 above that enumerated
by Sir William Hooker in the “ Synopsis Filicum‚’' here-
after to be noticed. The whole are arranged under nine
genera, of which Hymenophyllum and Tn'ohomanes alone
conta-in 254 species. The remaining fisty-one are divided
amongst seven genera, two of which contain a single
species each. He does not characterise any new genera,
and only adopts five of Presl’s. But his number of species
is so much in excess of that of other authors that, if he
really had specimens of the whole in his herbarium he
must have described hin species on the different forms of
fronds and other variable structure, which are always to
be found in an extensive series of herbarium specimens,
many such when carefully collated represent a single
specics only. ' ⁴
