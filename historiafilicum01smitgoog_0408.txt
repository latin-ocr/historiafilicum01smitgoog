They have a wide geographical range, chiefly tropical,
extending to Japan in the north, and New Zealand in the
south. With a few exceptione, they present great uni-
formity in general character and appearance3 in some
instances the same or closely allied species are found in the
old and new worlds. They osten grow among bushes, and
their fronds being indefinite they attain a great length.
In the Bellenden Ker range of mountains, Queensland,
Gleichenia Heu-manni is described as forming an impene-
trable jungle among tree Ferns and other treeS, attaining
the height of 50 or 60 feet, supported by its horizontal
pinnoe similar to quodiwm.

Ona—This genus is founded on a solitary species, first
found on the shores of the Gulf of Carpentmia, and since
then in other parts of tropical and sub-tropical Australia.
It is scarcely distinct from Gleichenia, except in the fronds
, being simple; in habit it resembles Jamesonia, but the
divisione of the fronds are even smaller than in the

⁴ smallest of that genus.
Sp. As above.
