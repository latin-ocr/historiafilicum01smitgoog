5.- ON THE GENERA ΛΝΒ THEIR CLASSIFICATION, As FOUNDED ΟΝ
ΤΗΕΙΒ MODES OF GROWTH AND HABIT.

In the preceding pages I have given a general view of
the principal writers on Perna and their systems of classi-
fication. I will now proceed to explain the reasons that
have induced me to attempt to draw up a natural arrange-
ment of FernS, reviewing as 1 proceed the data upon
which the genera are founded.

In my first general arrangement m 1841, Ι characterised
the whole of the circinato Ferns under divisione and tribes,
as shown in the abstract of my arrangement, given at
page 33, the characters of which are in general obvious, so
that any Fern with perfect fructification can readily be
referred to its proper tribe. A system of classification so
based is therefore practically usefiss, but it must be viewed.
as purely artificial, for, although many of the genera in
any one tribe are naturally allied in general habit, yet
others of totally different habit, but possessing the technical
character of the tribe, are found associated with them3
while on the other hand genera closely allied in natural
habit and organisation are placed in separate tribes. For
example, the genus Goniopteris has naked sori, while its
congener Nephrodium has indusiato sori, they are conse-
quently placed apart in any arrangement which is based on
the absence or presence of indusia. In both these genera
the species are numerous, and in many cases are so alike
that in the absence of the indusium, specimens of Nephro-
delum are referred to Goniopteria The same applies to the
extensive genera Lastrea and Pheqopteris, both of which
contain closely allied species.

When the indusium is absent in normal indusiato genera,
it is in general impossible, even by the most careful micro-
