In Phoenogamous planta, the flower and its parts, con-
sisting of calyx, corolla, stamens, pisti1s‚ ovary, seed, posi-
tion and mode of germination cf the embryo furnish the
data on which all systematic arrangements are based.
With the exception of the embryo these organs are in
general visible to the naked eye, and require but little aid
from the miscroscope. This, however, is not the case with
Ferns, at least as regards 'their organs of reproduction,
for although they have no visible stamens and pistils like
flowering plants, for generating seeds, neverthelcss it was
known to early observers that they had seeds, but so
small as to be invisible to the naked eye3 the microscope‚
however, revealed that they are of definite forms, which
was first observed by W. Gole in 1669, and it is recorded
that young Fern plants were raised from these invisible
seeds in the Oxford Garden in 1715.

At page 8 it is explained that these seeds are called
spores, and are contained in cases called sporangia,
which are of various forms, the form most common being
girded by a ring. When the sporangium is mature, the
elasticity of the ring causes it to burst, and, under favour-
able circumstances as regards light, the spores are seen
to issue like a pnff of smoke; this apparent smoke consiste
of atoms varying in form in the different genera, being
globose, oval, or angular, smooth, plain, striated, or echi-
nate, presenting very beautiful microscopic objeots. Much
examination is, however, yet required before they can bc
made practically available for assisting in defining genera or
