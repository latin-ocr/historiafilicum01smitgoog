scopic examination to discover that it ever was present3 that
urgan, therefore, cannot be depended upon for determining
the genera of the tribe Pheqopterideae by herbarium speci-
menS.

The relation of one genus to another is also governed by
the fertile frond being more or less contracted ; for instance,
all contracted fronds with naked sporangia closely occupy-
ing the whole underside, or in irregular masses‚ are referred
to the tribe Acrosticheae3 but in some this character is not
always perfect. For instance, in the genus Poeoizop teris,
the fertile fronds vary in their degree of contraction,
and some being but slightly contracted, the veins being
distinct, forming obviouswell-defined receptacleS,* which,
when viewed in conjunction with the general habit and
mode of venation, indicates the relationship of Poeoizop teris
to be with Menisciwn. This affinity is fiirther confirmed
on comparing it with the original herbarium specimens of
Meniscium simplem (hond. Journ. Bot. v. l, t. 11), which
are strictly charactoeistic of the genus Meniscium, but since
the species was first described it has been introduced in a
living, state to the garden collection, and has produced
fertile fronds so completely contracted‚ that if such state
had been in the first instance observed by the learned
author, he would not have hesitated in referring it to
Acrosticheoe. Other instances also occur to show that
Meniscium and Poecilopteris are naturally related.

I have now said sufficient to show that the placing of
such examples of naturally allied species in different genera
must be admitted as only an artificial convenience for
arrangement. .

The various forms and direction of the sori also consti-
