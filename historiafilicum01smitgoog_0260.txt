Ona—The above character embraces a large number of
widely distributed -specieS, abounding within the tropics,
and extending to the furthest limits of Fern vegetation in
both hemispheres. These numerous species vary greatly
in the size and circumspection of their fronds, agreeing in
general habit with the genus Pheyopteris, the want of
indnsia in the latter being the only technical distinction,
that organ, however, is osten very small and soon becomes
obliterated, and as stated under Nephrodium, when absent,
the species of Lastrea are consequently placed under'
Phaeqopteris. The indusium varies considerably in sizo and
*extare and in the depth of the sinus, the latter being
