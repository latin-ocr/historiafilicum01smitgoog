a good deal in outline, as above noted, and varying- in the'·
presence or absence of the involucre, whether from being
quickly deciduous, or, as I apprehend, its entire suppression
at times, it is hard to say.” From this view I differ, for,
in cultivated plants of P. planiuqineum, as well as in many
herbarium specimens of the same that have come under
my notice, I found no traces of indusium, and therefore
consider it to be normally absent3 it consequently comes
under the genus DryomeneS, while P. sinuata not only
differs in the general outline of the frond, but also in the
sori being furnished with a large peltate indusium, and
as it agrees in general* habit with P. Sinyaporiana, I
therefore associate it with that species.
