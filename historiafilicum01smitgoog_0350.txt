Tribe 21.—PTERIDEAE (Plate 21).

Fronde varying from simple, entire, to decompound mul-
tifid, and from 1 to 10 or more feet in height, and (with
the exception of Doryopteris) of a thin fiaccid texture. Veins
free or anastomosing, their apices combined forming a
transverse, marginal, sporangiferous receptacle, seated in
the axis of an exteriorly attached infiexed special indusium
forming oblong or continuous marginal sori.

Osa—I have already explained under Cheilantheae my
reasons for separating it from Pterideae, which as now

which the genera Pteria and Litobroohia contain the principal,
which technically differ in the venation of the first being
free and in the second anastomosed in various ways.
