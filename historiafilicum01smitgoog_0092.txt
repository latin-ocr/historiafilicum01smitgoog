ciated' with a host of species differing widely in habit.
Admitting that a greater or lesser number of species
possess some character in common to entitle them to be
called genera, nevertheless, genera may be said to have no
real existence in nature, but, by adopting them, we are
enabled to study and classify Ferns so as to convey to the
mind our ideas regarding the various forms and nature of
the numerous plants that come under our observation.

In the preceding observations Ι have shown that habit
is of great importance as a character for determining the
relationship of Ferns to one another, either as individual
species or groups of species, but habit is not always avail-
able, especially in describing from herbarium specimens
alone, for it is only the small growing kinds, with caudex
and fronds united, that are suited for the herbarium. A
great number consists of single fironda or even portione of
frOudS, only, consequently, the nature of their vernation is
unknown. Indeed, the great botanists of the present day
content themselves with describing plants from dried spe-
cimens‚ ‘many of which are osten small and imperfect, and
fail to convey the true nature of the plant in its living
state.

’ The celebrated botanist Mr. Bentham says :·-“I have
published several thousands of new species of plants, Ι
have never published one without examining it in a her-
barium, and Ι have examined very few in botanical
gardenS.” This practice I call unfortunate, for although
the living collection at Kew may not at any time exceed
one-tenth of the species in the herbarium collection, never-
theless it affords ample materials for verifying and'assisting
to correct errors in many descriptions made from herbarium
specimens only. With reg-ard to the collection of living
Ferns, which the author of the “Species Filicum ” calls
