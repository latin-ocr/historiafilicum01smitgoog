10. Tropical America. This region contains 946 species,
of which 708 are peculiar, thus showing that this
and the preceding are the two richest regions in

Ferns.
'I'he above is sufficient to give a general view of the dis-

tribution of the Fern flora over the earth.

With regard to the greater or lesser number of allied
species common to any district, Mr. Baker says, ‘⁶ The
remarkable point about the distribution of Ferns is, that
there is so little traco amongst them of the concentration
of allied forms in the same district.”

There can be no doubt that this view is consequent on
the character of the fructification being made the bond of
union of species, by which large unnatural genera are
formed as in the “ Species Filioumss’ which I have already
commented upon ; but on breaking up these large genera
we obtain smaller genera of a few or many naturally allied
species, which in many instances may be termed geogra-
phical genera, and which coincides with Mr. Darwin’s
view on the distribution of plants generally, for he says
that, “ Some few familie& many sub-families, very many
genera, and a still greater number of sections of genera,
'are confined to a single region, and it has been observed by
several naturalistS, that the most natural genera in which
- the species are most closely aHied to one another are gene-
rally local or confined to· one area.'’

In support of this may be mentioned the genera Nipha-
ὂοῑαε, Βνψιαπία, great part of Phymatode3‚ Ρῑαΐῃοθνὺιιπι, and
leamnopteriS‚ which have their head-quarters in the regions
of the East, and by restricting Davallia, as Ι do, to the
species with articulate vernation, all· belong to the Eastern
