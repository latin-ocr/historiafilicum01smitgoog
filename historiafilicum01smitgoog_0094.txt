As regards synonyme of both genera and species, Ι have
in the preceding pages shown that they may be bermed
legion, the number of generic names being above 500. To
quote all or any considerable number of them, would be
{zhe means of making this book much larger than desirable,
and add much to confuse studente and dismay them from
studying Ferme.

To each genus I have given ihs authority and date, fol.
lowed by its principal synonyms and reference to the genus
under which the species shand in Sir William Hooker’s

Foreign.’' These, with platee in this work illustrating {zhe
tribes and genera, and with the observatione under each
genus, will, Ι trust, be sufficient to convey to the sbudenb of
Ferus a knowledge of their nature and the data upon which
they are classified.

With regard to species, when few in a genus Ι have

Ι have already shown that it is the rule to retain the
original specific name of a¹ species under whatever genus
it may be placed by succeeding authors3 some writers,

appears as though the species were new and named and
