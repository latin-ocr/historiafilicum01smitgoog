widely spread over the tropics of both hemispheres3 and
on account of the apparent or but slightly varied forms
being found in different countries, has led to great con-
fusion in the species. In the “ Species Filicum,” under
Davallia polypodioides, Sir William Hooker says: “The
more I study the Ferus, and compare specimens from
different munti-ies, the more difficult Ι find it to define in a
specific character the essential distinguishing character of
species with the much divided fronds3 so different are
they, according to locafity, to age on the various portions
of the same individual, and other circumstances, Then the
nature and degree of pubescence augment the difficulty'3
and all these difficulties seem to be combined in the pre-
sent species.” Upon this view he unites about a dozen
specific names of authors under Davallia polypodioides of
Don, a species originally named and described by D. Don
on Nepal specimens. ⁴
