ΜΘ 19. ADIANTEAE. <Flam 19.)

Vernation fasciculate or sarmentose, generally hypogeous,
and becoming caespitose. Sori marginal, transverse, ob-
long, linear, or punctiform. Indusium lateral‚ exterior
attached, bearing the sporangia on its under surface.

Ona-This is truly a natural tribe of Ferus, having the
smooth, polished, and flaccid character of Lindsaea, but
differing in the indusium being attached exteriorly, and its
under surface venose, and bearing the sporangia‚ which
latter character distinguishes it from the tribe Pierideoe3
it is formed of a portion of the laminae of the margin of
the frond, which is changed in texture, its form depending
on the ultimate segments · being entire, or more or less
divided, thus varying from reniform, linear, to oblong,
continuone, occupying the whole margin of the segments.
These with 'reniform indusia are distinguished from
Oheilanthes not only by the indusium being sporangiferous
on its disk, but also by its being produced on the con-
vergent apices of two or more venules‚ whereas the sori of
Gheizanthes are seated on the axis of a single Venulo, ter-
minating m the axis of the indusium.

In the“ Species Fih‘cum” 109 species are described, but
in the‘ ‘Synopsis Filicum” the number is reduced to 62;
the first number was arrived at by Sir W. Hooker, after
more than half a century’s study of Ferns, and the latter
number by the editor of the “ Synopsis ” aster three years’
study of Sir W. Hooker’s herbarium. This is a striking
example of the different views taken by Pteridologists as
to what constitutos species. ¹*

⁴*In the Appendix to the‘ ‘Synopsis Filicum ’³ nineteen additional
species are described.
