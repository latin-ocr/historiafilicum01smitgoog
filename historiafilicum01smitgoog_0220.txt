OBsae-This small Fern was originally described by
Sprengel as a species of Gymnoqramma; but as it did not
appear to me to form any natural alliance with any of the
groups of species of that genus, Ι, therefore, in the Journal
of Botany for 1842, deemed it best to characterise ie as a
distincf, genus, The fronde in some stanes being simple,
and bearing only one norun, seems to indicate its relation-
ship with Monoyramma and Plcwroqramma.
