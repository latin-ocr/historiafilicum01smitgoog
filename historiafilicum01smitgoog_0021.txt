1.—NATURE AND NUMBER OF FERNS.

Tun plants which form the subject of this volume con-
stitute a special Order in the Vegetable Kingdom‚ tel-med
Fama, popularly known by the name of Ferus3 they are
plants of special habit and structure, and rank highest in
the class Cryptoqamia of Linnaeus.

From circumstances explained hereafter, the number of
species representing the present Fern flora is not well
ascertained 3 it is sufficient here to say that about 2509
have been described in books by different botanists‚ speci·-
mens of nearly that number being preserved in the princi-
pal herbaria of Europe, of which about a thousand have
been introduced in a living state, and cultivated in the
the gardens of this country. They are widely spread over
the earth, being found in the tropics and temperate regionS,
and extending nearly to the limits of vegetable life in both
the northern and southern hemispheres. In habit and
mode of growth the greater number come under the
category of herbaceous perennials, having seasons of
growth and rest according with the nature of the dif-

ferent climates they inhabit.
