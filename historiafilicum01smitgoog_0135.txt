osmernns or ‘rums-s Am> ornum. 109

Fertne pinnae linear, 6 to 8 inohes long, broad rachiform.
Primary vein-3 evidetur, short. Receptaoles compital, forming
a large quadrato sorus, in two transverse, nearly confluent
rows on each seg-ment (acrostichoid).
Type. Dryostaehyum splendens, J. Sm.

, OBS.-As a genus, this is distinguished from Drynama
by the upper portion of the frond being oontraeted inho
long linear sessile pinnae, bearing large quadrangulam sori.
The receptaele of each sorus may be viewed as formed by
{zhe confluenoe of four (normal) punctiform receptaeles,
brought together by the oontraession of the fertile disk,
forming a broad sporangiferons area between each two of
the primary veins, the sporangia bhus forming two rows of
squares on each pinnae. According bo Mr. Moore's elassifi-
astion, the seemingly amorphous sori leads him to place
this genusin Aerosticheoe, but he admits that in habit and

aspect it resembles Domum-ia.
Sp. D. splendens, J. Sm. (Beda. F. Brit. [ml. pl. 316);

D. pilosum, J. Sm.
OBS.——First discovered in the Island of Imzon, by

Cumings‚ and latterly in Singapore. D. pilosum is a much
smaller plania than D. splendens, and is -speeially distin-

guished by the sporangia being pilose.
