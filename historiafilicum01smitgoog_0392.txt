They are natives of Malay, Philippine, and Fiji islands.

M. pinnatum and M. Dwrvillei differ from the rest of the
species in having pinnate fronds ς their sori are, however,
characteristic of Micropodium. ’

Vernation fasciculate, orech, acaulose. Fronde simple,
entire, or lobed, from 6 inches to 2 and 3 feet long. Veins
forked‚ venules free, the superior and inferior branch of
each fascicle contiguouffi parallel, and sporangiferous on
their proximate sides, constituting· two linear, confluent

sori, each furnished with a linear indusium, the free mer-
’ gins of which connive, forming,¹ as it were, one sorus.

OBs .—'I'his as a genus differs from Asplem'um only 1n the
sori being confluens-1 in pairs, each furnished with its own
indusium, the free edges of which connive, and thus form-
ing a double sorus.

Although the connivens sori is the only point by which
this genus is distinguished from Asplenium, Sir william
Hooker has nevertheless in the “ Species Filicum ’' raised
it to the dignity of a. tribe which he names Scolopendrieae3
it contains only nine species, which he ari-anges under
four sections, namely, Euecolopmdrium, Antiqramma, Schaff-
