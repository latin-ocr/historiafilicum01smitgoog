countries of the eastern hemisphere and islands of the
Pacific, the numerous localities presenting different phases
of what some authors suppose to be one species only, while
De Vriese describes no less than 'sixty speeies. On judging
from my examinatien of authentic specimens from De
Vriese, in the Hookerian herbarium, I have no hesitation
in saying they may be safely reduced to one-sixth of that
number, indeed in the ‘⁸ Synopsis Filicum '’ the whole are
reduced to one species, namely, the original type, A„ evecta.
Judging from the aspect, and some special differences of
cultivated plants, I consider the ibllowing as distinct
species. The chief difference besides the aspects consists
iu the number of sporangia forming the sorus, which
varies from a few to many3 these numbers appear to be
constant and uniform in individual plants, but the various
intermediate numbers observed in others destroys the well
marked difference between the lesser and greater numbers.
In some a narrow fimbriate membrano is observed under
the sporangia, which is considered to represent an in-
dusium.

Ona—In Sikkim a plant of A. evecta has been measured
having a caudex 2 feet 4 inchoa high and 2 feet 6 inchoa in
diameter, the spread of fronds being 24 feet, being ten less
than a plant cultivated at Kew.
