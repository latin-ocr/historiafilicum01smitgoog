Presl by placing Maionia in alliance with Gyathea, with
which in habit and even in technical character no generic
affinity is traceable.

· In his general arrangement he follows, with a partial
exception, the sequence of Presl‚ arranging the whole
under two sub-orders, Gleichem'aceae and Polypodiaoeae, the
latter consisting of twelve tribes, beginning with Gyathea,
including Hymenophyzwm, and ending with Acrostichum.
With regard to daphnim, Polypodium‚ and Aspidium, he,
in a great degree, follows Mettenius and Fee’s arrange-
ment and descriptione of Aerostiohwn.

From what has now been stated it will be seen that, ·
although Sir W. Hooker bestows great pra-ise on his con-
temporaries, he nevertheless adopts but few of their genera,
thus making it appear that but littae advance has been
made in our knowledge of the natural habit and anato-
mical structure of Ferns siuee the time of Sprengel (1827).
He, however, finds himself compelled to divide his large
genera into seatium, which are equivalent to the genera of
authors3 indeed, it is only by the sections that we are
saved ὼε labour of wading through 200 or 300 species in
„aler to find out a. single individual.

The following is a tabular view of the sequence of
the tribes and genera as arranged in the “¹ Species
Filicum ” :—
