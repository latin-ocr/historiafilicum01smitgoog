orientalis. With regal-d to the two first, herbarium speci-
mens lead to the inference that they only represent one
species, nevertheless‚ cultivated plants are readily recog-
nised as being distinct. The Indian species differs in the
fertile pinnae being less involute and more flat than in the
preceding.

Although the species of Stmthiopteris are perfectly dis ·
tinct in mode of growth and venation from Onoclea sensibilia
nevertheless they are in “ Species Filicum” placed under
the latter genus, and S. penmylvawica is described as
having a special indusium to each sorus, but which I have
failed to discover.

Ona—This genus agrees in habit and venation with the
bipinnatifid species of Pheqoptercs, differing only in the
receptacles being elongated on the venales, thus con-
