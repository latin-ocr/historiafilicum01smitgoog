Ona—In general habit this genus agrees with Vittaria
and Antrophyum, being distinguished from the first by its
reticulated venation, and from Anismphyum by its strictly
transverse marginal sorus. As now restricted, the genus
consists of one speeies only, a native of the West Indies,

-and many parts of Tropical America.
Sp. P. angustifolia, Desv. (v v.) (Toenitis, Hook. Sp. Fit).

It is with some hesitation that 1 place this genus in
alliance with Vittaria, from which it differs in having fas-
ciculate erect vernation, and in the veins being compound
