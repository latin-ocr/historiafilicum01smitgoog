Hymenophyllaoeae have a wide geographical range,
abounding in the ssropical regions of Amcrica and the West
Indian Islands, in India, the Islands of the Indian and
Pacific Oceans‚ and ‘extending as far as New Zealand and
Lord Auckland’s Islands in the southern hemisphere, and
Norway and the Faroe Islands in the norbhern3 but very
sparingly found on the African continent.. They love
shade and moistrure, many being epiphytal and clothing·
trees like moss‚ or growing in shady ravines or caves3
but the same species osten occurs under different influences‚
and consequent-‚ly assumes different appearances‚ which has
led to an unnecessary increase in the specific nomenclassure.
The number of species varies according to the views held
by different authors, 172 are described in the “ Species
Filicum,” and are nearly equally divided between the two
genera, Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes, which in the
“ Synopsis ’' are reduced bo 149.

This, however, falls far short of the number given by
Dr. Van Den Bosch‚ who, in his “ Synopsis Hymenophylla-
cearum,’' enumerates no less than 302 species, as already
shown ab page 31.
