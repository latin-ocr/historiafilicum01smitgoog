place it in Oheilantlzeoe.

OBS.—This genus is founded on a solitary species of very
distinct habit, a nafflve of Mauritius· 11: was originally
placed by Swartz in Adiantum, but it is readily distinguished
from {ahab genus by the sporangia being seabed in the axis of
the reflexed indusium and not on its disc, w’hile the conver-
gence of the fertile venules distinguishes it from Pteris.
