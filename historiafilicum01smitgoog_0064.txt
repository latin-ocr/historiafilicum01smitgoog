Ι must state that after much study of this arrange-
ment Ι have not been able sufficiently to understand it to
make it practically useful. Ι do not clearly see what
object the author gains by introducing sectional names not
before used in the genus, more especially as these names
(Oaenopteris, Eupterie, Neuropteris, Doodya, Pleocnem‘a‘a, dvc.)
are apparently not given as special sectional names, but
used comparatively—that is, all the species under Goenop·
teris, Eupteric, dvc„ are presumed to have venation similar
to Ferns bearing those names. Therefore, in order to
ascertain the venation of one Fern, it is first necessary to
be acquainted with the venation of that with which itis
put in comparison. As, for example, to know Dictymia‚ it
is first necessary to be acquainted with the character of
the venation of Doodia and Pleocnemia. Unfortunately
tm, the analogy in these two cases is far from obviouS, the
genera in both cases being in every respect of quite dif-
ferent habits. I therefore see no good reason for making
such genera as Doodia and Pleocnemia. types for arranging
other genera by venation.

With regard to his arrangement of Pkeqopteris and
Aspiciam, of which he enumeratos in consecutive order
299 species—thus viewing them as parts of a single genus
—of these sixty-eight belong to the first part, Pheqopterim
the remainder to the second part, Aspidium. I do not
consider it necessary to enter into further details. I will
only add that the sectional names are upon the same
principle as those of Polypodium, and that, in my opinion,
a simple generic name for groups of naturally allied
species, would render their study much easier than the
complicated comparative similitude with one another.
Mettenius has also published a memoir ou the genus,
Asplenium and several other genera.
