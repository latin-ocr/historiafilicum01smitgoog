M. Fee gives a systematic arrangement of his method of
claseification‚ which occupiee nearly five double-colnmned
pagee; but the many divisione, snb-divisione, figures,
lettere, and πίοι-ἰοὶ, renders it necessary to be very care-
fully etudied before it can be well understood. The fol-
low-ing is sufficient to show M. Fee’s mode of clmi'ying
genera, from which it will be seen that plante most
opposite in natural habit are associated, consequent on
characters derived from the form and position of the sori,
and in being naked or indusiato and the different forms of
the latter, and therefore cannot be considered otherwise than
as an artificial arrangement of complicated comtruction.
