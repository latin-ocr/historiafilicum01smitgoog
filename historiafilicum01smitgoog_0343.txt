Ona—This genus is founded on a peculiar and remark-
able Ferri, originally discovered in Brazil by Dr. Gardner,
and described in Vol. VI. of Hooker’e “ Icones Plantarum‚'’
under the name of Cassebeera qleichenioides, in which genus
it ie retained in Hooker’s “ Species ’⁹ and “ Synopsis Fili-
oum,” but as it always appeared to me not naturally related
to the typieal speeies of cambam, I therefore deem it best
to separate it as e. distinet genus, In eo doing Ι, how-
ever, find it diffieult to determine its position in this
arrangement, but its small eonoave indusaeform lobes, eon-

* taining the epora-ugia, seems to indicate affinity with Myri-

teris.
