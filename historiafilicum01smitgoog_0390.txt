referred to Bl'echnum by Presl, and to Pteria by Mettenius‚
but according to my view the blechnoid or pterioid character
of the sori is entirely consequent on the narrowness of the
segments. It varies in the form of the frond‚ some· being
nearly simple, others forked, which seems to show a relation·
ship with Asplenium septentrionale.

It is a widely diffused species, found in many parts of
India, Ceylon, Arabia, Egypt, Abyssinia, southward to
Zambesi-land and Angola.

lea-mmm, Bake,- (1873).

Vernation uniserial, sarmentum slender, wire-like, scan-
dent. Fronde linear-ligulate, entire, 9 to 10 inches long,
§-inch broad, obscurely crenate-repand, membranous, smooth,
stipes short, articulate with the caudeX. Veins distinct,
patent, usually simple, sporangiferous along their centre,
their whole length. Indusium bivalved‚ one on each side
of the vein, linear, ·narrow, margins conniving, enclosing
the sporangia, ‘forming numerous contiguous sansage-like
sori.

Osa—I have not seen this curicus Fern, but learn from
Mr. Baker that it is a native of the Solomon islands, and
that the genus is founded upon a solitary frond, rising
laterally from about an inch of wiry-like caudex to which
it is attached by w⁸hat appears to be a joint. As it cannot
be well associated with any Erymobryous genus, I therefore
for the present place it in Asplenieae‚ with which it agrees
in the general asplenoid habit, but is peculiar in having a
double indusium te each receptacle.

Sp. As above.
