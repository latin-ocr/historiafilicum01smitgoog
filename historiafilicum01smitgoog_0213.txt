to differ chiefly in degrees of length and breadth, fihe whole
presenting but fev'v obvious points of differenoe of speeific
value. He also attaches much important-,e to sshe different
forms of the abortivo sporangia (paraphyses), the number
of articulations forming the ring, and the form of the
sporangia, but much more investigation is wanted before
these microseopie characters ean be made available for
determining speeies. The following are the prinoipal
well-marked speeies,

*Sporanqia intramaryinal5 Hook. Syn. Fa„ t. 6, fiq. 56, b. o.

Ex. V. scolopendriae, (Pteria, Bory3 Hoplopterie, Presl‚·
Toeniopsis, J. Sm.) (v v.) ; V. falcata, Kze. ; V. Gardneriana,
Fee; V. stipitata, Kze. ‚· V. stricta, Garm, ‚· V. lineata, Sw.
(v v.) (Toeniopsis, Bedd. F. S. Iud„ t. 54.) ς V. remota, Fee.

*²*Sporanqt'a in an extrose alit, maryi‘n not involute,

V. elongaba, Sw. (V. zosteraefolia, Willd) (v v.); V. ensi-

OBS.—In the “ Synopsis Filieum ” this with eight other
speeies are included as synonyme of V. elonqata. V. stricta
is a native of Tristan d'Aounha, and in general appearance
is similar bo V. lineata, but differs in the short sarmen-
tum being covered with undulabe, orisp squamae, not stiff
and filiform as in V. lineata. Speoimens collected by
Griffiths in Bootan have the same kind of oriep squamae
as sshose from Tristan d’Aounha.

81.—PTEROP818, Desv. in part (1827).
Pieris sp„ Lina.
- Vernation uniam-iel, sarmentum short. Fronde contiguous,
simple, linear acumina'oe, 6 to 18 inehes long, rigid, smooth.
