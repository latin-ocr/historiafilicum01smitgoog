species with both free and anastomosing veinS, the technical
character consisting· in all having a reniform indusium.
Schott restricted the genus to the species having anas-
tomose veins only.

In the “ Species Filicum” thirty-four species come under
this character, of which the following· arethe principal.
It is well to notice that great confusion exists in the
synonyme of many of the species3 for instance, Aspidium
molle, which is a very cosmopolitan species, has no less
than a dozen names placed under it as* synonyme, some
having· erect and others decumbent vernation, which

. evidently marks them to be distinct specieS, but at the

same time possessing no special marked difference in the
character of the fronde. They present at least two very
distinct modes of growth, one set having fasciculate verna-
tion and another uniserial, thus forming two group8‚ which
may be viewed as characteristic of two natural genera.
