Ona—This genus is founded on a unique and rare Fern,
as yet only known fio be a native of Mount Ophir, in the
peninsular of Malacca. On account: of the sori being
furnished with a pelbabe indusium I originally placed st in
Aspideae, but with which st has no other point of relation-
ship. With Gleiohenia (with which I now associate it), il:
not only agrees in habit but also in the character of the

sori, differing only in the sori being compital and indusiate.

Ona—This genus is founded on a remarkable Fern, a
native of New Caledonia, of which there are specimens in
{she Kew Herbarium, but bhose having arrived since {she
failure of my sight I have consequenbly not been able to
examine them. It was first, described as a new genus by
Mettenius in 1861. In the firsb part of lahe “ Synopsis
Filicum‚” published in 1865, Sir William Hooker places it
in memnonia, with which ἰὴ agrees in lzhe sori being formed
