of many localities in tropica] America‚ also found in Trini-
dad, it is peculiar for having two or more sori on some of
the branches of the veins. Being arborescent, and the sori
criniferouS‚ has led several authors 150 refer it to the genus
Alsophila‚ but from which it differs in the vernation (base of
the stipes), being criniferous‚ which is not the case with
true Alsophila. The evidence of its being a tree Fern rests
entirely on Wildenow’s description, which says “ caudex
erectus arboreouS,'’ but according to a plant at Kew, which
in 1864 had fronds 2 to 3 feet high, the caudex was decum-
bent, but which probably only required time 150 assume an
arboreous character ; whichever it may be, I find it difficult
150 point out its relationship with any sequence of genera,
except that 115 may be ranked with Lophosoria in Pheqopteris.

Nora—In the preceding tribes the sori are discal ; and

Vernation fasciculate, decumbent or erect, and* becoming
arborescent. Sori marginal, globose, or transverse ob-
long, furnished with an interior attached special indusium,
which connives more or less with the changed indusioid
margin of the frond, the tw0 forming an urceolate, bi-
valved, marginal cyst, containing the sporangia.

OBS.—Hitherto I included under this tribe the genera
Sitobolium‚ Lindsaea, Microlepia, and other allied genera,
which, although agreeing in the technical character of
their sori, nevertheless differ widely in habit, so much sc,
