ς 3. Pilularieae (Gen. 1, Pilularieoe, Lin.)
§ 4. Marsileae (Gen. 1, Moroika, Lin.)

The above classification shows that Mr. Moore has be-
stowed great ingenuity upon its formation, but I cannot
view it otherwise than as an artificial arrangement founded
upon certain technical data that normally characterise all
true FernS, whatever size, habit, or mode of growth they
assume. We need not therefore be surprised at finding,
associated under the same sectione, genera of extreme un-
natural habit and mode of growth as also differing essen-
tially in their vascular structure, such as J enkimia and
Platyoerium; Monoqramma, Hymenolepizt, and Gymnoptmin
Lomoyramma, DrquZomm, and Toeniopsis; Brainea, Mi.
nmium, and Dryomeneo ; Didymochloena and. Mesochloena3
Galymmodon, Steqnoqramma‚ Gymnoqramma‚ Struthioptewls,
J amasonia, and Drymaria5 Onoclea, Polystichum, and Ne-
phrolepisf Cystopteris and Humata; and Woodeia and Hy-
poderris .· the placing of these in their respective sections
being entirely guided by the character of the fructification,
without regard to natural habit. Any system of classifi-
cation of Ferns based upon these principles may be
viewed as analogous to the Linnean classification of phaeno-
gamous plants.

I have now to notice the next part of this work,
which consiste of an alphabetical arrangement of the
whole nomenclature of Peme, collated from the publica-
tions accessible to the author, “ and blended with such
personal information as the author has been able to bring to
bear upon the subject.” In order to appreciate , the extent
of thiswork, it is only necessary to state that up to Sep-
tember, 1862* 396 pages were published, and which

⁴* Up to the present time, 187 4, no addition to the above has been
published.
