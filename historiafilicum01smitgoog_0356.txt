Osa—The latter species is a noble Fern. A plant
received from J amaica, and cultivated at Kew, attained in
1864 a stout caudex, nearly a foot in height, producing·
large, spreading, firm fronds, upwards of 10 feet long„
with stipes at least 4 inches in circumference, thickly beset
with muricate prickles. The large size and different
aspe'ct of this species from its congeners‚ when viewed
with· its stout arboroid caudex, seems sufficient to render it
worthy of being ranked as a distinct genus.

Vernation fasciculate, erect, subarboroid, laniferous.
Fronds bi-tripinnate, 2 to 6 feet long, the ultimate pinnoe
sinuouse-pinnatifid. Primary veins costaeform, pinnate ;
venules anastomosing, forming irregular hexagonoid areoles.
Sporaqujferom receptacleo transverse, on the apices of 4 to 5
venules, converging on the sinus of the lobes, forming an
arcuate sorus on each sinus. luctuosum linear.

Ona—‚This genus was founded by Linnaeus on tab. 71 of
Plumier’s Filioes, which is' represented as having an arcu-
leate stipes, but as no modern specimens of Lonchitis have
been observed with that character I am inclined to oon-
sider it a mistake of the artist‚ the other parts of the figure
agreeing with the species described by Hooker as L. Mn.
deuiam, a native of Venezuela, Plumier’s figure being
derived from a Martinique plant.
