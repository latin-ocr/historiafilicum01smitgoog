Aspleniwm and Scolopendrium sp„ Hook. Sp. Fil.

Vernaiion uniserial, sarmentum slender‚ wiry, scandent.
Fronds distant, simple, linear-lanceolate, rarely pinnate,
1 to 2 feet in length, 1 to 3 inches in breadth, smooth. Stipes
in some articulate v'vith the caudex. Voins simple or forked,
sporangiferous on one or both sides. Indusium simple as in
:inplendum binate as in Dv’plazium, or oppositely conniving· as
in Scolopendrium. Scri linear continuone, having an elevated
ridge or crest on their exterior side or between them.

Type. Scolopencmum lonqifhlium, Presl. *

OBS.—The principal character that has led Mettenius to
separate the species of this genus from Asple‘nium, is that
the vernation of several of them is apparently articulate, as
also having an elevated ridge on the exterior side of simple
sori, and also between the connivent sori. The articulated
vernation, if it really is s0, is confined in this family to this
and the preceding genus, but as the nature of the fronds
agree with Aspleniwm, I therefore deem it best to place
them here ; they form a very natural group‚ distinguished
by their slender creeping caudex from the great mass
of Asplenium.

OBS.——The ‘sori of Asplem'asm, Diplazium, and Scolopen-
drium, are often produced on the same frond of this species.
