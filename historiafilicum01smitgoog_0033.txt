called veins3 these veins, which either radiate fr0m the base
of some fronds as also from segments‚ in a flabellate
manner3 but are more generally produced from a midrib
(costa), which in simple fronds is a continuation of the
vascular cords of the stipes; and in segments of fronds, a
· branch of the rachis from which they are produced.

The costa is generally central, or in some excentric‚ or
even quite on one side of the segment (unilateral) ; it
generally terminates at or near the apex of the frond or
segment, or it becomes undefined before reaching the apex,
or is very short, rudimentary, or absent. It is generally
elevated in the form of a ridge on one or both sides of the
lamina, or it is in the form of a channel on the upper side,
or it is imbedded in the substance of the frond, and then
osten obscure.

From the sides of the costa veins are produced at a more
or less distance from each other, and generally equal or
nearly sc, on both its sides; they form a more or less
acute, oblique, or nearly a right (patent) angle with the
costa, and when free always directed outwards towards the
margin or apex of the frond or segment. They are either
straight, curved or flexuose, and are either simple or branch
in various ways, the first are termed primary veina, their
branches venales, and the branches of these vcinlets, each
being a diminutive of the preceding. In many cases the
primary vein that rises direct from the midrib is very short,
and branches sometimes close to the midrib, or even within
the substance of the midrib, as in Neottopteris aunt-aliam,-
in others they terminate at or near the margin, and when
parallel to one another and very evident are termed συείω-
jhm, and the diminutive costulae is applied to the primary

veins of laceanee.
Veins are termed free when all the branches of each
