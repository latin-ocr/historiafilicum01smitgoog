into a few species. In the “ Species Filicum '³ six
species only are . enumerated .3 but having· had the oppor-
tunity of examining· not less than eighfi species in a living
state, has led me 10 increase the number to about a dozen·

Sp. N. undulata (Sw.) (v v.).

OBS. —Sir Wm. Hooker unites this with N. tubero-sa, but
viewing living plante proves them to be very distinct. The
fronds of the present species dying down annually, whereas
in N. tuber-osa they are permanent.

N. pectinata (Wilzd.) (v v.) 3 N. pendula (Rada.); N.
exaltata (Sw.) (v v.) 3 N. cordifolia (Idan.) 3 N. tubex-osa
(Bm-y.) (v v.)3 N. volubilis (J. Sm.) 3 N. ensifolia (Sw.) (vv.);
N. hirsutula (Sw.) (v v.)3 N. biserrata (Sw.) (v v.) 3 N.
splendens (Wald.)3 N. davallioides (Sw.) (v v.) 3 N. abrupta
(J. Sm.) (Leptopleura abrupta, Presl.).

Ona—This species is a native of Bourbon aud is probably
not distinct from the preceding one which is a very elegant
species, a native of India and J ava3 it differs from other
species of the genus in the upper pinnae being· conizracted,
which are sinuously lobed, each lacinae and lobe bearing a
sorus, furnished with a nearly orbicular indusium, the free

⁴ exfcrior marg-in of which connives wissh the margin of the

lohe, which becomes partially reflexed‚ and thus forming as
{t were a bilabiafie cyst‚ analogous 1ῑο the tribe Dicksom'oe,
which circumstance led Presl to characterise it as a distinct
genus under the name of Leptopleura.
