Vernation fasciculate, erect or decumbent‚ acanlose.
Fronde deltoid lobed‚ pinnate or bi-tripinnate‚ one to two
or more feet in height, smooth‚ castanaeus or glaucous,
pinnules articulate with the rachis, or to a short adherent
petiole. Veins forked3 venules free. Receptacleo terminal‚
the sporangia becoming laterally confluent, forming a con-

Ona-This genus as here restricted consiste of about
twenty or thirty species, which are widely spread over the
tropics and sub-tropica] regions of both hemispheres, with
the exception of P. qeranioefolia3 the species of the Eastern
and Western hemispheres are respectively distinct.

At page 278 Ι have stated that it is more on account of
habit and texture that has induced me to place this genus
under Cheilantheae‚ than under the tribe Pterideoe. In some
species originally placed under Pezzaea, the sporangia occupy
¹a portion of the upper part of the venules‚ forming short
’ linear sori, in such cases the apices of venules being free
and not connected in a transverse receptacle as in true
Pteria ‚· consequently the inflexed margin cannot be viewed

,otherwise than as an universal indusium analogous to
Allosorus.
