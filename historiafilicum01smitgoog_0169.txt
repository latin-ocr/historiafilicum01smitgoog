there are instances of different degrees 01 anastomo-

plant, therefore, setting aside the general acrostichoid
character, Paecilopterie naturally associatos with Memmium.

Fee refers sixteen species to this genus which in the
‘⁸ Species Filicnm '’ are reduced to twelve, and in the
“ Synopsis Filicum '³ the species are placed under two
sectione, Gymnopteris and Chrywnlium, which between them
contain 36 species, part of which have no natural affinity
with either the original species of Poecilopteris or Gymnop·
teri33 several even have articulate vernation and consequently
belong to the division Eremobrya.
