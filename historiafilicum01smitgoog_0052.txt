able number of new species, many of which appear to be
founded , on very imperfect, and not well-authenticated
materiale. A few of his new genera are admissible and
will be noticed in their respective places 3 the greater
number, however, are untenable ; for instance, he describes
about fifty species of the genus Blechnum, of authors, which
he arranges under five genera, namely‚ Blechnum, Parablech-
num, Distaxia, Μθεοιῖιωηα, and Blechnopsis ,· the differential
character of these genera is, however, so slight that Ι do
not consider them worthy of adoption (see Blechnum).

Another instance of oreating genera on what may be
called fancied differenceS, is the genus Niphobolus of Kaul-
fuss, of which Presl enumeratos thirty-nine species arranged
under eight genera. On examining numerous sets of herb-
arium specimens said to be species of this genus, I find the
intermediate forms are so numerous that it is impossible to
collate them, so as to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion
as to what number of them are distinct species, for with all
the evidence that has come before me, I have not been able
’ to define more than about a third of the species recorded
by Presl, all of which Ι continue to retain under Niphobolus‚

Many other of Presl’s genera have as little title to rank
as such as those of Blechnum and Niphobolus‚ and I deem it
best not even to notice them as synonyms‚ as it would only
add to the already overburdened Fern nomenclature.

In the preface to this book it is shown that it is now
more than fifty years since the writer commenced to study
the collection of Ferns in the Royal Botanic (iarden at
Kew, then amounting to about forty exotio species ; and,
having had the opportunity of profiting by the verbal
observations of Robert Brown, who often directed my
attention to the mode of the arrangement of the veins
in different species of the genus Polypodium, as forming
