Ona—This genus was founded by Linnaeus in 1737,
the typical species being Acrostichum aureum, but subse-
quently he, and other authors, added numerous other
species to the genus, indeed it may be said that all Ferus
in which the sporangia were not evident in well defined
‘round or linear masses were referred to this genus, as
shown by Moore’s “ Index Filicum,'' in which no less than
473 generic and specific names are recorded, of which
about 140 now constitute the tribe Acrosticheoe: the prin-
cipal are given as examples under the respective new
genera as above defined.

The genus Acrostichum‚ as here restricted, consists of
only one specieS‚ namely, A. aureum, which is found 111
most Fern regions throughout the tropice of both hemi-
sphereS, which under the different influences of climate,
and growing in wet or dry places assumes -very different
aspects as regards size and texture, such being the case,
has led to a dozen or more specific names being given by
authors to the different states. In the “ Species Filicum ”
they are all recorded as synonyme, in which I concur.
