The whole of the above are natives of Wesb Indies and
America, extending tc Galifornia and Chili3 lzhe greater
number being found in the tropice.

No represenizative of the genus is recorded from Africa
except the aben-anfi species, G. cnszfhmue (Polypodium
enmfforme, Thunb.)‚ a native of South Africa, which, although
agreeing in venation‚ nevertheless differs essentially in,the
texi-,ure of labe frond, which is thick and coriaceouS, with
immersed obscure veina, and large uniserial sori. In these
respecta ila has the appearance of a Pleopeltis or Phymatodes,
but is entirely destitute of scales,

The genus Syuamia of Presl is founded on P. triloba of
CavanilleS, and wissh it is associated Grammitis elouqata of
Swartz. The firsb is recorded above, and differs only from
true Goniophlebium in having oblong sori3 the other, which
has also oblong sori, but differs essentially in habit, as also
in venation, I place under Pleopelbis.

In G. inaequale the cosi-,al areoles are void———that ie, desti-

tute of a free venule‚ in thais respect agreeing with the
allied genus thebodium.
