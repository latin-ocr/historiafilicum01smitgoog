extended only to Goniophlebium, being 11118 seventy-{zhird
genus in alphabetical order, up to which are enumerahed
1‚7 38 species with their synonyms ; from ‘obis data it may
be calculated that the number of species, when the work is-
complebe, will amounlz to above 4,000. As an instance of
the labour and investigabion required, Ι will select iahe
genus Aeros-lichum. Under this· original generic name of
Linnaeus, no less than 461 specific names are enumerat-ed
in alphabetical rotation‚ with references to their authoritieS‚
occupying twelve pag-es ε with the exception of nine names,
the‘ whole are in italics, signifying that they are synonyme,
the nine being in roman type, indicating that they arc the
only true species of Acrosticlzum as now adopted. When
complete, this ‚work will be an invaluable treasure to
Pteridologists.

executed plabes of new and rare Fer-ne, each plaiae con-
