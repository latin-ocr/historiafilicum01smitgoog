Osee-This consiste of a few species, differing from
Diplazium, in the veins being parallel and acutely anasto-
mosing near the margin, which lether, characterises it from
tho following genus, Calbipteriffi in which tho venales anas-
tomose in pairs between the pri‘mary veins.

ons—Naaman of India, {Ma-lay, and Philippine Islands. ·

The two first species were originally described as having
only simple fronds, but we now possess specimens of simple
and pinnato fronde growing from the same root, which
shows the necessity of being careful in describing species
from inadequate materials.

Vmation fasciculate, orech, subarboroid. Fronde pinnato,
