previously characterised under the name of Athyrium‚
which has been viewed by most authors as a section of
Asplenium, but which, for the sake of natural arrangement,
I have adopted as a genuS, and restricting true Allantodia
to the present species.

Sp. A. Brunoniana‚ Wall.

Hab. A native of Ceylon, Nepal‚ and Java, also found in
Otaheite. ’

OBS.—This genus is founded on a magnificent Fern, a
native of Tropical America and West India blande, h'aving
a stem 5 to 6 feet in height, bearing a crown of pinnato
fronde. measuring 12 to 14 feet in length. The chief point
that distinguishes it from Allantodia is in the indusium
being plane and in the exterior margin of the reticulated
venation being combined by ¹a transverse vein running
parallel with and close to the margin. These slight dif-
·ferences are scarcely sufficient to characterise it as a genus
