Osa—In my original definition of this genus in 1841, ’

the venationis said to be free, , which is strictly the case
with several species which Ι then placed under it (now
species of Lomariopsis). Since then I have had the oppor-
tunity of examining living plants of S. scandam, in which
I find the pinnae of the sterile frond have a transverse
anastomose vein continuone with and close to the mid-rib,
but which on account of the narrowness of the fertile
pinnae is not evident, the sporangia occupying the whole
segment as in Lmnaria, which with its narrow involute
indusoid margin indicates its affinity to be with the present
tribe Blechneae, rather than with Acrosticheoe.

generally spread throughout India, the Malayan Archi·

Pacific‚ assuming different appearances according to the
various local influences of climate, which has led to its
being described by authors under many different names.

sinuoso, two of such forms having been named by Wallich
