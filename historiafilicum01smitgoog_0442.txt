ΟΒΒ.--Τ1ιο general habit and mode of development of
the fronds of this genus does not differ from Anqiopteris, it
ie, however, readily distinguished by its sporangia being
wholly united, the two series forming a double multilocular
spere case, which, when mature, opens lengthways in two
lobes (valves), each lobe containing a series of cells equiva-
lent to the sporangia of Anqioptem's. Marattia is sparingly
represented in India, but it is common to the Islands of the
Indian and Pacifio Oceans, extending to Norfolk Island and
Now Zealand in the South, it is also found in South Africa,

' Tropical America, the West Indian Islands‚ and is one of

the few plants forming the indigenous flora of the Island
of Ascension. ¹

Presl enumeratos ¹twenty species, which he places under
four distinct genera, but 1 find no sufficient character to
warrant their adoption, his species are also fully double in
excess. In the “ Species Filicum” only seven species are
described, and the following, which have all been cultivated
at Kew, appear to me to have sufficient character to be
considered distinct species. Different fionds, or even dif-
ferent parts of the frond of the same plant when separate,

and placed· in the herbarium, have been accepted as at
, least four distinct species.
