OBS.-This genus is founded on a remarkable and rare
Fern, first described by Willdenow in 1810, from specimens
collected in Venezuela by Humboldt and Bonpland. At
the time of the publication of Hooker and Bauer’s “ Genera
Filicum ’' I had not seen specimens of this Fern‚ and there·
fore followed Presl in retaining it in Pterideae ‚· having
subsequenssy received specimens‚ I find iius nabural asso-
ciation bo be with Dmomenea Dictyoptevia and Aspidium,
especially such as A. macrophylbum‚ with which it agrees
in habit and venation, but differs from Aspidium in having
the sporangia produced close to the margin, and forming
an apparent linear sorus parallel with the margin which is
inflexed in the form of a narrow membraneous indusium,
which circumstance led authors to refer it fo Pteris. I, how-
ever, view this Fern as an aberrant form of the Aspideae

alliance.
