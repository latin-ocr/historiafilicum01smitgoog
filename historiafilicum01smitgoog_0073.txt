searches of future writers, and which ought therefore to be
gratefully acknowledged; a middle course has been
pursued between the highly multiplied genera of Presl and
J. Smith, and the too meagre enumeratione of Willdenow,
Sprengel, Link, Kunze, and others.”

By adopting the above view, hundreds of species become
massed under one generic name, regardless of their dis-
similar habits and anatomical structure. For instance, the
genus Polypodium, as characterised in the “ Species Fili-
cum‚'’ contains 407 species, amongst which are found the
greatest diversity of size and mode of growth‚ as also in
anatomical structure. The small grass-like species cha-
racterised by Swartz and others under the genus Gram-
mitis, and the many small pinnatifid species represented
by Polypmliwm trichomanoideS, Swartz, and P. pectinatum,
Linn., and otherS, rank with the large fronded genus
Drynar‘ia of Bory, and the large decompound subarbores-
cent species of the section Pheqopteria This is consequent
on all Ferns having round or oblong sori being placed
under the genus Polypodium. Upon such data, setting
aside habit, the Tree-Fern genus, Alsophila, R. Br., might be
correctly referred to Polypodium. 'Phe same applies to
Aspidium and Nephrodium, which, between them, contain
227 species of very varied habit and venation.

Then, again, all species with linear naked sori diverging
from the mid-rib, whether on free or anastomosing veins,
and of whatever habit of growth‚ are placed under Gymno-
9rammw, of which he enumerates seventy-four species, even
including the genus Selliquea of Blume, which differs from
the whole of the Gymnoyramma alliance in having articu-
late venation. With regard to Acrostichum, 167 species
are described, which Fee and other authors have placed
under fifteen genera, many presenting a very distinct habit
