dium pruinatum, by later authors it has been referred to
Alsophila, under which genus ii: stands in the “ Species
Filicum,'' but it differs from the true species of thais genus
in having deltoid multifid fronds. The only character
rhais gives it a claim to rank as a species of thais genus is
iias arborescent stem, and criniferous sori, which, in some
specimens the laid-,er character is scarcely evidenia3 {zhe
stem also differs from izrue Alsophila in being densely
laniferous, indeed, if it was not for its arboroid stem I
would have no hesiiaation in placing it under Pheqopteris, as
an ally to Pheqopteris laohnopoda.‘ Presl has considered it
worbhy of being raised to sshe rank of a distinct genuS,
which, iu order to mark its peculiarities I adopt, and,
with Trichopteris and Amph-idemnium, view it as an aberrant
genus of this firibe.
