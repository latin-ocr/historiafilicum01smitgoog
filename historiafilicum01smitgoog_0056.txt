More than thirty years have now elapsed since the above
arrangement was drawn up and published, and during that
time about 1,ΟΟΟ cultivated species have come under
my notice, as well as many additional herbarium specimens
new to me, the consequence of which has been to greatly
alter my views in the definition of genera and their
arrangement, which is explained further on.

The next general arrangement of this family of plante to
be noticed is that of Professor Fee‚ of Strasburg‚ who in
1852 published his ‘⁶ Exposition des genres de la famille
des Polypodiacees.’' This great work consists of 387
pagos of quarto letter prees, in which is given the cha-
racters of 188 genera, with observations and examples of
species of each genus, which are illustrated by figures
occupying thirty-two platos, the whole evincing great
talent and research. In this work 2,140 species are enu-
merated of annulate Ferns3 he follows Presl's method in
dividing them into two divisione founded on the direction
of the ring, but restricts Helicogyrateae to the tribe
Cyatheae, thus excluding Gleicheniaceae, which is not taken
