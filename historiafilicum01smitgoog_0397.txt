OBS.—'I'his genus is distinguished from other simple-
fronded Asplenioe by the apices of the parallel venules being
combined by a continuone marginal vein ; it has a wide
geographical range, being represenoed throughout India,
the Malayan peninsula and islands, Southern China, Philip·
pine, Sandwich, and other islands of the Pacific Ocean,
extending to Australia and Norfolk Island in the south,
and J apan in the north.

In Seemann's “ Botany of the Voyage of the Herald '⁹
it is there recorded to have been found in one or two
localities on the Pacific side of the continent of America,
but this seems to be a mistake‚ as the Hookerian herba-
rium contains no specimen of the genus from the American
continent.

The simple form of the fronds does not afiord much
variety as regards difference that can well be explained in
words, yet they vary very much in size and texture, which
in some instances seem to be normal to the special localities,
and which gives the semblance to there being a number of
distinct species, thirteen being enumerawd by Poe, which
in the ·‘ Species Filicum ” are reduced to seven3 even this
is more than can be satisfactorily determined by herbarium
specimens only. The cultivated examples of four forms
known to me, although difficult to recognise as distinct
when put in the herbarium, are, however, readily seen to
be distinct species in the garden, and it is probable that
