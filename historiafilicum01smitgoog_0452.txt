species (see page 37). Although these speres are so small
they are neverbheless endowed with an extraordinary
power of tebaining their vitalii-,y3 and, being easily wasted
by currents of air, readily accounss for 11116 wide geogra-
phical range of some species of Ferns. When naburally
or artifically placed under favourable conditions they burst,
and expanding in 11116 form of a simple oblong 6611, 611

, which 6111161· cells are suecessime developed‚ ultimately

form a thin green membrano called 11116 protkalliwm,
which, when arrived at full size, is of a reniform cordate
shape, or sometimes bilobed, or oboordate, varying from
about ξ 116 ὲ inch in diameter, and adhering 116 the sul-face
on which it vegetatos, it has much 11116 appearance of a
small foliaceous lichen or Μαι-6116111116. In time a small
bud makes its appearance near 1116 base of the prothal-
lium, which increases in size, and ultimately a small frond
is produced, which is sueoeeded by others successively
lat-ger, thus becoming a plant.

The increase of 11116 prothallium and sproufing of 11116 bud
is readily seen by 11116 naked eye, and the cultivator is
satisfied with 11116 result ‚· but he finds himself oflzen dis-
appointed, for after having obtained abundance of prothallia
from many different species, they πνοι-1111616611 do 11611
always produce a bud germ. This is now supposed 116 be
explained by 11116 discovery made in 1848 by 06111111 Suminski,
a Polish bouanist, that Ferus possessed organs analogous
116 tho stamens and pisi-ils of flowering plante, and that
these were produced on 11116 under side of 11116 prothallium ;
they are represenssed by two kinds of cells, one called
Antheridia and the other Archeqonia. The first (of which
there are generally between 30 and 40) consisl: of round
cells, which contain vermicular spermatozoids that issue
from 1111666116 when arrived ab maturity. ‘The cells of 11116
