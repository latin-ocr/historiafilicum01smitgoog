OBS.-—-This ἴε a well-marked and distinct genus of Ferns,
its typical representative being the well-known Polypodiwm·
quercffolium of Linnaem, which receives its specific name
from the fanciful likeness of the sterile frond to the leaf of
the common oak. In some efficies, however, it is much
larger, even to a foob in lenglzh, Μουθ- cordate, entire
sinuoso or deeply laciniated, and of a firm mady texture.

This genus consists of about] nine known species, widely
distributed over the Eastern hemisphere, in Mauritius,
Ceylon, India, China, Malayan‚ Philippine and T ropical
Polynesian Islands, and Australis..

In general they are epiphytal, their large broad fronds
imparting a special character to fihe trees on which &hey

grows
