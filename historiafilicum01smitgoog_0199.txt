crumenas or ‘ramus Am> emnam. 163

tracted 3 pinnae rachiform. Venales evident contiguous,
parallel, and sporangiferous nearly their whole length.
Sporanyia confluent, forming a broad, transverse, compound
sorus. Imbasium narrow, attached 011 the interior edge of
the margin, involute.

Type. Aorostiohum triquetrum, Wall.

OBS.—In my herbarium Acrostiohum triquetrum of Wallich
and the species now associated with it long stood as a distinct
group of Lomaria, and had also been early noticed as
such by Kunze‚ and afterwards by Mettenius, who separated
them as a distinct genus under the above name, in allusion
to the obliquity of the ring of the sporangia 3 but this I
find to be only partially the case in one species, and as a
generic character I consider it not worthy of consideration.

Six species are at present known referable to this genus,
which in the “ Species Filicum '⁹ are retained as a ‘section
of Lomaria, with which they agree in general aspect, but
are destitute of squamae and are peculiar in the base of the
stipes being swollen3 as also the fertile seg-ments not being
furnished with a transverse anastomose‚ the venules rising
direct from the costa, and bearing the sporangia nearly
their whole length, sufficiently distinct to be viewed as
linear sori, similar to that of Gymnoyramma, but differing
in being furnished with a revolute indusium as in Lo‘maria.
Under these circumstances I find it difficolt to determine
its natural position; the character of the fertile pinnae,
however, indicates its affinity to be with Llavea.
