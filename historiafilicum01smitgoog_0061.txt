Beeides his general work on Polypodiaceoe, M. Fee 1166
6166 published several memoirs on special genera, accom-
pam'ed by 11811166, one forming a volume devoted to the
tribe Acrosticheae‚ in which he ari-anges the species under
nineteen genera.

vittam-ia and ite 611166 form another memoir ; of Vittaria
alone he describes and figures no 1666 than twenty-five
species and five doubtful, but the examination of numerous
sets of specimene justifies me in reducing the number to
1666 than a dozen.

Ι have now given a general view os the systematic
arrangements of Presl, my own, and Fee’S, by which it win‘
116 66611 that the first important divisional character 16
derived from the different directione of the ring that 6111.
rounds the eporangium. My reason for again reverting to
this subject 16 111 order to show that in some Gyatheae the
66 called obliquity of the ring 16 111616 apparent than real.
In my arrangement of 1841 I have stated my views on
this point. Ι have there explained that the apparent
obliquity of the ring in Gyatheae 16 due to mechanical
pressure, the eporangia of each 661116 being crowded and
sessile eeated round a columnar elevated receptacle, and
each sporangium being inclined upwardS, consequently the
pressure against each other imparts to them an oblong-
flattened form especially in the lower part on their 1111161·
