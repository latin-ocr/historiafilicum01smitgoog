OBSe-The habit and general appearance of the Fern
forming this genus is so peculiar and unique that it is diffi-
cult to point out its place in any natural sequence. Its
ffiextnre, its articulated pinnules‚ and its terminal sori, indi-
cate some connection with Nephrolepis, with which it also
agrees in the apices of the veins being marked by white
dots, which form a conspicuous row on the superior side of
lzhe pinnules.

In my observation on this genus in 1841 Ι have said
that “ this is the only genus in Aspideoe besides Mesochloena
that has elongated sori‚’' upon this character Mr. Baker‚
in the ‘⁴ Synopsis Filicum,'' has united Mesochlaena with
Didymochloemt, thus making a second species, which he
names D. polycarpa. In doing this he entirely set-‚s aside
natural habit, as well as the position of the sori, and nature
of the venafiom for in habit Mesockloena scarcely differs
from the group to which Ivephrocbisum molle belongs, with
which it agrees in the lower pair of venules anastomosing,
and the sori being medial on the venules, and which is
entirely ab vai-ianoe with the charnaim· of Didymochloena.
Upon sshe same principle the simple fronded Fern Facbyenia
prolzjfera is referable to Didymochlaena.
