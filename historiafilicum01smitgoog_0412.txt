of a definite number of sporangia and the ring being horl-
zontal, its mode of growth is, however, very different from
Gleiahenia, the caudex being woody, erect, and branching,
bearing tufts of fronds in many respects similar to Oleandra
nerifformis, but differs in having pinnatifidly pinnate fronde,
much resembling the larger forms of J amasonia.

The above character is drawn up from description and
from notes communicated to me by Mr. Baker.

(Hymenophyllaoeae, Pu).

Fronde membranous, generally pechid, entire, or vari-
ously compound, from less than au inch to a foot or more
in length. Sporanqia sessile, compactly seated round a
columna-r termina] receptacle, which is formed by a free
prolongation of the venule, included within a bilabiate or
urceolate usually vertical cyst‚ open exteriorly, ⁸

OBS.-'I'his is an extensive and very distinct tribe of
Ferns, differing from all others by the extremely delicate
and in general thin pellucid texture of the fronds‚ and also
by the form and attachment of the sporangia. The fronde
vary much in form and size, some being simple entire,
forked or flabelliform, not more than half an inch in length,
while others are more or less compound, or multifidly
divided into fine hair-like segments, and vary from a few
inches to 1 or 13 feet in length.

The distinct habit and peculiar structure of the speran-
gium led some Pteridologists to characterise Hymenophylleoe
