Osa—This genus is readily known by the thick coria·
ceous fronds being covered with stellabe pubescence‚ which
gives them a hoary appearance when young3 in some
species this pubescence nearly disappears in age, especially
on the upper side of the frond.

About forssy species have been named and described by
different authorS, but a critical examination has led me to
believe ffiaf‘ not more than one-half of that number are
distinct species, In the “ Species Filicum,'' the number
is reduced to twenty-tWO, which Ι believe mighss be still
