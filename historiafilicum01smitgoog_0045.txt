It would occupy too much space to enter into a review of
the many works , and the different views entertained by
many of the above authors regarding the characters of
genera, especially as all matters of importance relating
to genera will be found noticed in their respective places.

The chief characters adopted by many of the preceding
authors for defining genera consist in differences in the
form and arrangement of the sori, and in the different forms
of the indusium when present, and even some on the texture
and pubescens, and in the contr-action of the fertile fronds.

By the conj oint labour of authors the number of genera
have been considerably increased since the time of Swartz‚
making the total number up to the time of Sprengel
sixty-five‚ several of which may be ‚viewed as natural
genera. Eight are founded each on a single species, six
contain two to four each3 while the old Linnean genera

half of the whole number enumerated by Sprengel.
Although this great number of species agree in the techni-
