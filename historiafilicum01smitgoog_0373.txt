Ona—The type of this genus was originally described as
a species of Bleckmvm, under which genus I placed it in
1841, my first arrangement, bnt on account of its very
distinct habit I now deem it best to ‚separate it from
Bzeohnum. With Lomaria Boryana it agrees in having
a stout arborescent caudex, bnt differs in having regular
pinnatifid pinnae, which are articulate with the rachis.
