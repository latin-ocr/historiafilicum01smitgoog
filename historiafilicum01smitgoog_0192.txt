156 casmenas or cramus Am) ossum.

OBS.—Mr. Moore in his “ Index Filicum‚'’ has made
A. ensiforme a type of a new genus which he names
SooliosoruS, of which he says, “ This plant, having neither
nebbed veins nor netted sori, cannot belong bo Antrophyum,
and is quite distinct from every other established genus.”
This view is consequent on his having derived the cha-
racter of his genus from Hooker’s figure in the “ Icones
Plantamm‚” tab. 394, in which the sori are shown to be
interrupted, and with no veins visible. An examination
of herbarium specimens, however, shows that ‘ohe fronds
are traversed by veins which form irregular hexagonoid
areoles. The sporangia are superficial and only partially
occupy the venules‚ forming linear forked generally
tortuous sori, their incomplebe reticulabion is not sufficient

character 110 warrant the adoption of Scoliosorus as a
separaize genus.

69.—LOXOGRAMMA. Presl„ in part. (1836).

Gymnoqramma sp„ Hoolc. Sp. Fil.; Grammitis, sp„
Bl. and Wall.

Vernation sub-fasciculate, decumbent, rarely short,
sarmentose. Fronds simple lanceolafie, 6 bo 18 inches in
length, coriaceouS. Veins infernal, obscure, rarely evident,
uniformly reticulated‚ forming oblique elongated areoles.
Receptacles compital, linear, forming oblique, naked sori.

Type. Grammitis lanceolata, Sw. ·

Grev., Ic. PL, t. 53; Moore Ind. Fil„ p. 51, B.

OBS.—-Hitherto this genus has been placed in alliance
with Selliyuea, but izhe vernation of Loaeoqramma being
adherent, brings it more in alliance with Antrophyum,
from which it differs in the sporangiferous receptacles
