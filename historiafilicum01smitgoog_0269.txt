Ona—This genus is founded upon a remarkable Fern, a
native of India, J ava, and other Malayan Islands. Like
many other Fame, its habit alone is sufficienfi to mark it
as a disfincb genus, buia in venation and character of its
sori ib differs bub little from Lam-ea, the principal difference
being in tho form of the indusium, which is attached by its
broad base, as in the Eremobryos genus Leucosteqia3 and
on that character alone Mr. Moore places fihe species of
Leucosteqia under Acrophorus‚ in habit as two genera they
are, however, quite distinct.
