OBS.—This genus is founded on a Fern which I originally
'described in Hooker and Bauer’s “ Genera Filicum '' as a
new genus, under the name of Geratodactylis, without at
the time being aware that it had been previously described
under the name of Llavea, by Lagasca. In habit the sterile
portion of the frond resembles Osmunda reqalis, and the
fertile pinnules by their revolute membraneous margins,
have much the character of the fertile pinnae of Struthiop-
teris and Allosoru8‚ while the forked linear sori gives it a
claim to be associated with Gymnoyramma. .

Sp. L. cordifolia, Lay. (v v.) (Geratbdactylis osmundioideS,
