successive development form a stem (caudes), which is .
either erect or more or less decumbent. The caudex varies
in sizo, according to the normal nature of the species. It
is often very short, even consisting of a bud only, scarcely
rising above the surface of the ground-such is termed
mulceo—or it forms a low stem a foot or more in height
(arboroid), or it assumes the height of a tree (arborescent).
Second— Uniserial. This consists of a creeping rooffing
stem, termed sarmentum, which progresses by the succes-
sive evolution of single fronds from its apex, each succeed-
ing frond being produced from the base of the preceding
one, at more or less distance in advance. It either con-
tinues simple or brancheS‚ and varies in thickness from
that of a thread to an inch or more in diameter, and is
either epiqeous, hypoqeous‚ or epiphytal.

Articulate vernatio‘n also presents two forms. First—
Fasciculate. This is peculiar to a few Tree Ferns and the
order Marattiaoeae, in which the fronds when mature fall
away, leaving marks of rhomboid scars on the stemfl*
Second -- Solitary. This consists of a creeping stem, ’
termed surculum, emitting roots from its under surfiace,
by which it adheres to the earth or other bodies, but
generally trees (epiphytal)‚ rarely hypoyeous. It varies in
size from short and thick to long and slender‚ and when
young is densely covered with scales (squamoe). It is
either simple or branching, and is distinguished from the
sarmentum by its apex being always in advance of the
forthcoming frondS. These are produced singly from
special nodes on its sides, with which the base of the frond

(stipes) is articulate, and there separate on becoming
mature, leaving the mark of a round, slightly concave

soar or cicatrix.
