tinct species may be doubted by some Pteridologists3 but
be that as it may, there can be ,no doubt but that the
“ Species Filicum '⁹ and “ Synopsis '' are highly valuable
to students of Ferns,* possessing herbaria or cultivated
cellections, as also to travellers abroad.

Ῐ have now to notice another important work by
Mr. Baker, published in 1870, namely, that part of
Martiuffs “ Flora of Brazil,'’ containing the Ferns3 a folio
work of 317 pages, with fisty platee, each plate containing
many figure! of portions of fronde, showing the differential
characters of ‘tho genera and species. Of the latter there
are 387 described, the genera being arranged in the same
order as in the “ synopsis Filicum.” On taking into consi-
deration the extensive territory of Brazil with its various
climates favourable to an growth of Ferus, from those
growing at clevations that may be termed sub-arctio, to
others luxuriating in the lower hot valleys and “rocky or
forest ravines, the number of 380 species may be con-
sidered small ς but here again comes stne question, what is
a species P and judging from Mr. Baker's now, it would
appear that· many plants originally described as species,
which successive authors have acknowledged to be distinoe,
are, nevertheless, in many cases regarded as synonyms;
thus Ferns long accepted by previous pteridologists cease
to be so, When Ι say long accepted, I go upon the
evidence of Link, Kunze, Schott, Mettenius, and myselfi,
who have had for many years under their observation
living examples of species all well recognised as being
different from one another by some important characters
seen only in the living state, but Mr. Baker, with herba-
rium specimens, makes no scruple of lumping many of such
