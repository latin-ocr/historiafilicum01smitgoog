OBS.—Grawwnitis was first established' by Swarizz in his
“ Synopsis Filicum '' in 1806, where he enumeratos uwelve
species, all agreeing in having, “ Capsulae in lineolis rectis,
sparsis, Indusia nulla,'' bui: differing in habit and venation
so much that succeeding authors have distribubed the whole
except G. maryinella amongsb seven different genera.
Since Swartz’s time the discoveries of Blume and others
have added many species possessing the same habit and
character as G. wyinella, and when groupe'd together
these form a very natural genus, all having simple linear
fronds of grass like appearance, and oblique oblong or
linear naked sori in a single row on each side of the mid,
rib. The form of the sorus, however, as in other cases
is not always oblong or linear, buia somelzimes quite round
(punctiform) and then does not differ technically from
Polypodium, in which the group is placed by Mettenius‚

and followed by Sir William Hooker in his “ Species· -

Filicum.’' This amalgamation is due bo these authors
adopting the form of the sori alone as the distinguishing
character for the genus Polypodium, thus including all Ferus
with round or oblong naked sori without· regarding the
extraordinary dispariby in the size, form, and mode of
growth of the numerous species. Thus sshe present group
having fronds like blades of grass are associated in the
