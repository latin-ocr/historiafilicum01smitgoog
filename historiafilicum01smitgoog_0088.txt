“68 ox GENERA mn SPECIES. ν

the division Eremobrya generally arrive in good con-

dition, while those of Desmobrya, especially such as have

slender stemS, are often dead or in a very enfeebled stato
on their arrival.

The difference in the structure and mode ot growth of
the species of these two divisions may be admitted to be of
equal importance for classification with the difference in
structure of Exogens and Endogens in flowering plants.
In all attempts to determine natural relationship on any
special organ or structure, exceptions are never wanting.
In the present case, examples of connecting links are in a
few instances found between the two divisions. This is
particularly so with the genus Elaphoylossum, which con-
sists of numerous simple-frondet] Ferns, and may be
viewed as a truly natural genuS. In many of the species
the stipes have an evident articulation situated in some,
more than half an inch above its base, and in many
of the species it is marked by a slight swelling ; and ἡ
also by the part below the swelling being of a dark colour.
No change, however, takes place in the structure, the bun-

' dles of vascular fibre pass uninterruptedly through the
apparent articulat-ion, but they are evidently weaker at
that point3 for, when mature, the stipes separate there,
the base portion remaining attached to the developing axis,

which is either fasciculate or uniserial and adherent. I
- therefore place Elaphoqlossum in Desmobrya.

Another instance of the stipes being jointed above its
base is characteristic of the original species of the genus
lVoodsia, as also in species of Arthropteris; but the base of
the stipes being adherent, indicates their position to be
in Desmobrya. Also special examples of the articulation
of the stipes in fasciculate vernation is exhibited by the
genus Trichopteris and several spec-ies of Gyathea5 sor
