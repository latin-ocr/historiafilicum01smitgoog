OBS.—This genus consiste of a few large compound-
fronded Ferus, natives of the East Indies, Malay, and Philip-
pine Islands‚ and one is found in Tropical West Africa. In
general habit they resemble the preceding genus, as also
Aspidium, as here restricted, but differing in having a
more simple anastomose venation, and from the latter in
being destitute of an indusium3 but the latter character
is probably not always normal, for in cultivated plants of
D. «vm-efflare a very minute indusium was observed in the
early stage of the sori, but as the sori increased in size
it lest no trace of its having been present.
