bevertheless very distinct not only in the spore cases being
destitute of 6 ring, but 6166 in the vernation being terminal
and articulate with the axis of development, similar to
certain species of Gyathea already notioed. This articula-
tion must not, however, be eonfounded with the Eremo-
bryons division Polypodiaooe, in which the fronds are pro-
dnced solitary on the sides of the axis. In most of the
