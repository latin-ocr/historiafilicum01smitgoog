to describe it as a Fern, to which Linnaeus gave the name
of Polsypodium Baromea.

About fisty years ago the late Mr. John Reeves, who had
long resided ab Gauron, succeeded in obssaining living planbs
of it, which he transmitbed to this country, and which first
produced fructification in the Birmingham Botanic (iarden,
which having come under my notice it became ab once
obvious tlhat it was a species of Oibotiwm, and which, in my
Definition of Ferus, 1841, I called 0. Barometz.

A closely allied species, Ο. meninyii, is found in Luzon‚
and another, G. Assumica‚ in Assam3 lzhis Fern also
appears to be represenoed in Sumatra, as some of the
sofb silky hairs similar to those of Barometz have been
imporbed from that island into Holland, under the name of
“ Penghawar D’joumbi‚’' and are found to be useful as a
shyptic.

C'. Chamissoi‚ 0. Memiesii, and Ο. qlaucum, nativos of
the Sandwich IslandS, differ from Ο. Barometz in being
arboresoent, the stem of Ο. qlaucum attaining· the height of
24 feet, the crown of fronds adding· 12 feet more, making
the total height of the tree 36 feet. The base ofthe stipes
of the fronds is densely furnished with fine silky hairs,
which being permanent closshe the stem, forming a thick
wool-like coat, which is collected and used for sbuffin‘g
cushions, mattrasses, and the like. During the ten years«
previous to* 1865 it became an article of commerce under
the name of Pulu, and ship loads of it were sent to Aus-
tralia and California, but lately it⁸has fallen into disuse.

Dialosonia chrysotricha.

This is a trec Peru, a native of Java. Its sssky hairs
have been imported and used as a shyptic.
