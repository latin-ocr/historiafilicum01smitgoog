OBS —.This genus agrees with Polybotrya in general
habit, but is technically distinguished by the veins being
combined by a transverse marginal vein. Olfersia was
originally founded by Raddi on a Brazilian Fern which
he named 0. corcovodensi3‚ which is described as having
the fertile pinnae linear entire, thus differing from the
usual* forms of Ο. cervina, in which the fertile pinnae are
pinnatifid. Presl in his “ Epimellia Botanica‚” raises
Ο. corcovadensis to the rank of a genus, which he names
DorcapteriS, but which is not tenable, for I have observed
both forms produced on the same plant.
