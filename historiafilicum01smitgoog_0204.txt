OBS.—Thie genus is founded on a very peculiar Fern,
which on account of the reflexed margin of the pinnae was
referred to the genus Pteris by Swartz, but it having been
found that the sporangium was produced in the centre of
the pinnae, in the form of a single round sorus, led to ite
being characterised as a distinct genus by Hooker and
Greville‚ under the above name, in the “ Genera Filicum‚’'
however, Sir William Hooker says that “ Mr. Bauer’e
dissectione, and Mr. Smith’s investigatione, show that there
are 'several small sori, which eventually become confluent.”

This ie one of the peculiar Ferne spoken of at page 12
of the Introduction, that continue to form and develope
pinnae from the apex of the frond, which lengthene indofi,
m‘tely ae long as the plant continues to receive influencee
favourable to ite growth.

It ie found only in the Andean regions of Tropical
America, where it has a wide range, presenting different
appearancee in the various localities in which it is found ε
the different states being described by Kunze under at least
five distinct species, which in the “ Species Filicum ’' are
considered ae only synonyme of J. imbricata. Mr. Spruce‚
however, who has etudied them in their native localities
informs me that he considers there are at least two distinct
