Ona—This is a native of Sonth Africa, and varies con·
siderably in the character of its fertile pinnae, some being
so conti-acted as to justify the species being placed in
Lomaria, while others are broad, and have distinct Blech-
noid sori. Swlopendriwn Krebsii of Kame, also a native
of Sonth Africa, is considered by some to be a state of this
species3 it differs in the transverse soriferons vein not
being straight, bnt forming numerous acute angles pointing
outwards, the interior sides of the angles being sporangi-
femus, thus facing one another as in the scolopendroid
genus Antigyramma, which character led Kunze to refer it
to Soolopendriwm. In the “ Species Filicum ’⁹ it is viewed
as a synonym of L. pwnomlata. But as living plants of
both forms have been under my notice for many years, and
as both have retained their respective characters, Ι am
therefore inclined to consider them as distinct species.
