Gleicheneae and Cyathcoe, with either of which it has no
natural relationship in habit. This may be termed a truly
paradoxical Fern, for Ι find it difficult to fix its position 'in
any sequence of genera3 its partially reticulated sori
seem to point to Hemionites, and the form of its fertile
segments to Llavca and Allosorus, Ι therefore place it in
proximity to these genera.

OBS.—In the Fern houses at Kew this Fcrn sprouted
abundantly on all moist surfaces, and grew luxuriantly in
the Victoria Lily tanks.

rribe 10.—V1TTARIEAE (Plato 10).

Fronde simple, entire. Veins simple, reticulated or
compound anastomosing, combined at the margin in a
sporangiferous receptacle, which is seated in a slit or
groove. ’

Osse—This tribe contains about a dozen species of grass-
like Ferns, and as they do not well naturally associate with
other genera Ι follow Presl (in part) in ranking Vittarieae
as a distinct tribe. Setting aside the difference of venation
as a divisional character, they would then rank with the
genera of the tribe Hymenolepidieae.

Vernation uniserial‚ sarmentum, short, furnished with
hyalino scales. Fronde contiguous, caespitose, simple, linear,
