their appearance at Kew‚ the only specimen in this country
then known being in the herbarium of the British Museum‚
which I had not then seen. The botanical collecbor, Allan
Gunningham‚ failed to find it in Tasmania, and was very
much surprised on my presenffing him with fine specimens
grown at Kew. This was also the case with Doodia
blechnoides, and Aspzem‘um squamulata, by what means the
spores of these plante found their way into the pots at sshe
hothouses at Kew it is impossible to say.

In spite of the very delicate nabore of tho prothallia,
it is nevertheless endowed with great vitaliizy, as may
be seen by F'erns appearing on dry rocks, walls, and
such like, resisting the extremes of heaf. and oold. For
example, in 1829, 1 found a plant of Oeterach officinarum
growing in a crevice of masonry on one of the towers of
the new palace ab Kew (since {zaken down). As this Fern
is not found wild near London, it would be useless to
speculato where {zhe solitary spore came from; it seemed,
however, to have found a proper nidus in the crevice‚
enabling it to germinate and resist all untoward influences‚
to pass izhrough the prothallium sinte, and become a plant.

Ι must here state, that. not long aster Counb Suminski’s
discovery became known to me my sight began to fail,
which necessitabed me to give up the use of the microscope,
therefore my own practical observatione on this important
subject are but limited. ’

In many cases Ferns not only reproduce their like by
spores, but also by the viviporous buds generally produced
on the upper side of the frond‚ or on the apex of the fronds
or segments, which when mature become plante. This is
specially characterisbic of many species of Asplem‘um,
Goniopterie, Woodwardia‚ Memmium, and oizhers3 bui: so
far as has come under my notice, no bulbils are produced
