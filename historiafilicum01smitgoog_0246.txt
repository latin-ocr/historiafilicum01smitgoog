In Seemann’s Journ. Bot., 1869, p. 240, a second species
is described, namely H. Scamnum, a native of Nicaragua,
which is adopted in the “ Synopsis Filicum ’⁹ Addenda,
p. 460. I have not seen specimens of this.

the margin, bearing globoso pedicellate sori. Sporanqia

OBS.—'I'his genus is founded on a remarkable Fern‚ a
native of N ew Caledonia ; in habit it greatly resembles the
multifid fronded specimens of Aspidium trnffoliatum and
allied speciae, but its marginal pedicellate sori marks it as
specially distinct even as not belonging to Aspidcae ; relying
upon the character of the sori alone, there can be no doubt
that Sir W. Hooker is right in describing it as a species of
Deparia, but from which it differe, and from all Diales-oniae,
in having anastomosing veins.

In native and cultivated specimens that have come
under my notice, I observed some of the sori to be intra-
marginal, and even some of them seated on the upper side
