obhere, form the section Chilopteris of the genus (hammitis
of Presl‚ bnt if he has had true specimens of G. linearis
under observatiom he has not noticed the connecting mar-
ginal vein which is peculiar to this specieS, and which has
also been overlooked by the author of the ‘⁴ Species Filicum ;”
and, as connecting marginal veins are admitted as of suffi-
cient valae bo constibube genera, such as Aoom’npteri8‚ offam-eia,
and Neottopteris‚ I therefore use this peculiarity in this
group of Ferns bo characterise Lomaphlebia as 6 distinct
genus.

Fronde linear, repand sinuose‚ moniliform or pinnatifid,
rarely pinnate, or more compound‚ from 611 inch to
6 foot or more in length. Veins free, sori punctiform‚
naked.

Ona—This tribe embraces 6 gronp of small, slender
Peme, consisting of about 50 or 60 species, but ‘in many
cases the difference is so slight that it becomes difficult to
determine the exact number of distinct species. In the
“Species Filicum ” they are 611 placed under Polypodiwm,
in the section Eupolypodium‚ which embraces all free-
veined species without regard to the vernation being
articulate or adherent. They present two forms of
vernation‚ the greater portion being fasciculam, forming

caespitose uastas, a few being· sarmentose, with the fronds
more or less distant..
