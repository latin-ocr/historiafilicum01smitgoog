auxilliary characters in the grouping of species, which with
his publinlmd observations above noticed, 1, in time, consi-
dered myself competent to publish my viewS. This 1 did
in a &catino eutitled “ On Arrangement aud Definitione of
the Genera of Ferns‚” which was read before the Isinnean
Society in 1840, and afterwards published in Hooker’s
“ Journal of Botany,” in the volumes for 1841 and 1842,
occupying 131 pagos, and accompanied by a plato showing
the principal forms of venation. In this 1 characterised
143 genera, accompanied by examples of a few of the most
typical species of each genus, and with observatione on the
natural affinities of the genera. Just aa my treatise was
completed, but before its publication, I received Presl's great
work “ Tentamen Pteridographeae,'’ and it was gratifying
to me to find that my views in general coincided with those
of that celebrated Pteridologist. Ι, however, differed from
him in some important particulare, chiefly with regard to
the relationship of the genera to one another, consequent
on the data on which Presl founded his tribea, placing
naturally allied species Far apart. My endeavour was to
associate the species possessing the same general features
in respect to their *modes of growth (habit), so as to form
namral sequenoes of genera. This Ι have endeavoured to
complete by drawing up a general arrangement, *which
forme the second part of this volume.
