same genus with Drynoeria and Pheqopte‘rie of this work.
Under Chemmites I comprehend all the simple linear-
fronded forms having free veins and one row of sori
on each side of the mid-rib, the sori being more or less
oblong or linear or sometimes even punctiform, the single
row being the chief distinction between it and Gtempteris.
This latter genus, however, also contains a few single-
fronded species, but they have a higher degree of develop-
ment, the fronds being normally pinnatifid and each lacinae
having its mid-vein with soriforous venules on each side.

Blume, in his “ Flora J cvanica‚'’ figures and describes
no less than twelve species of &amitis as nativos of J ava.
Not having seen specimens of many of these, and the
figures being much alike, I am quite unable to arrive at a.
satisfactory conclusion regarding them. Sir William
Hooker also appears not very satisfied with many of them.
It can only be by careful examination and comparing them
one with another in a living state, either in their native
country or brought together under cultivation, that the
species can be determined‚ th'ey are widely dispersed,
being found in both hemispheres, the greater number
are found in the Malayan Islands, and extending to
Australis.. ¹
