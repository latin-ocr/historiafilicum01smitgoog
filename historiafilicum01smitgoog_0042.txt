J. E. Smith‚* wh0, aster the death of the younger Linnaeus,
became by purchase the owner of the Linnean Herbarium.
He published many botanical memoirs, and one on Ferus
in 1793, in the fifth volume of 1116 “ Memoirs of the
Academia of Turin,'’ in which he characterised thirteen
new genera—viz. ε Darea, Scolope‘ndrium, Woodwardia,
Lindsoea (Dryander, MS), Vittaria, Davallia‚ Dicksonia
(L'Heritier, 1788), Gyathea, Hymenophyllum, Schizaea‚
Gleichc‘nia, Marattia, and Danaea. These, with the Linnean
genera, raised 1116 number 10 twenty-four, which 116 divides
under two sections—viz„ Annulatoe and Exannulatoe. The
technical difference between these 0011616116 111 the spore
cases being furnished with a ring, or destitute of a ring.
This mode of arrangement 1166 611106 116611 adopted by all
systematic writzers on Ferns‚ as defining' two (1161111101. orders
which will 001116 under special 1101106 hereafber.

The nexfi general systematic work was 1116 ‘⁶ Synopsis
Filicum’' of Dr. Swnmtz, published in 1806. In that ex-
06116111 work nearly 700 61160166 are described, and 6
grear many doubtful species enumerabed. The de-
scribed species are classified under thirty-six genera, being
an increase of twenby-five since 1111066 of Isinnaeus. Eleven
of them are founded on species removed from Linnean
genera, their separation being due to a special organ which
I have already described under 1116 1161116 of indusium, by
some called imolam-um. Although this organ was noticed
by Adanson and Necker, yet it was not employed by
Linnaeus in characterising his genera. It was first specially
made use of by Sir J. E. Smsth, in characterising his new
genera, and also about the same time by the German
1101611161, Roth, and was adopted by Swarfiz in 1116 611ον6-
named work, in which 116 arranges twenty-five of the

⁴* Afterwards Sir J ames Edward Smith.
