ΟΒ8.-111 the “ Species Filioum '' the above 1111166 species
are oonsidered as forms of one only. As regards X. Jame-
soni (of which I have not 86611 specimens), it is said that
the izexture is so rigid thais the thread-like mid-rib remains
aster the pinnae fall. This singularity appears bo me bo be
sufficient bo mark it as a distinct species. They have a wide
geographioal range through Tropioal Amerina. the West
Indies, sandwieh Islands, and also West Tropioal Africa3
X. serrulam being one of the few Ferns common to both

Continents.
