and which contains no less than 2959 names, of which
335 are adopted species, the rest being synonyms.

The greater number were originally comprehended under
two genera, namely, Aspzeniwn and Diplazium, but even
these are not considered by some to be generically distinct.
In tho greater mass the veins are free, in a few {zhey are
anastomose, and which with the different modes of growth

afford sufficient characters for arranging the species under
the following genera.

Ona—In the “ Species Filicnm'’ about 287 species are
enumerated, which are divided into four sections, namely,
Thamnopteroe‚ Eusasplenium, Athyvium, and Eudiplazium,
which 1 characterise as distinct genera. In “ Ferns,
Brit-‚ish and Foroignss* 120 species are enumeraoed as
having been seen by me in a living state, and as they
contain examples represen’ning the principal sections and
group8‚ Ι here enumerate them.
