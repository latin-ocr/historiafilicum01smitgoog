Ome—The name Goniophlebium was originally given by
Blume to a section of Polypodium, consisting of a few
species, natives principally of the Malayan Islands. Presl
in his “ Tentamen ” raised the name to the rank of a
genuS, under which he enumerates eight specieS, three of
which constitute Blume’s section Goniophlebium, the others
being natives of the West Indies and Tropical America.
He also characterises another genus, and adopts for it the
name Marqinaria, first given by Bory to P. incanum of
Swartz. Under this genus he enumeratos thirty-six
species, which he arranges under two sections. The
first contains nine speciest, which differ entirely in habit
from his second section‚ which consists of twenty-five
species, sixteen of them, with the exception of M. amoena,
being natives of America‚ and possessing no character
either in habit or venation to distinguish them from
Presl’s American species of Goniophlebium. The other
nine like those of the first species, although agreeing in
venation‚ nevertheless differ entirely in habit.
