OBS.-—This genus as founded by Presl consisted of only
one specieS, namely Davallia immersa of Wazziqh, which has
pale deciduous fronde, rising from 'a hypogeous creeping
caudex. Although the character of the sori differs little
from {zhab of Humata, its disbinct habit does not allow it to
be associated with that genus or with Davallia; which is
also the case with olzher species of Davallia of authore, which
Ι here place under Leucosteqia. They are widely distribubed
throughoui: the same coun'ories as those of the preceding.

OBs.—In Moore’s “ Index Filicum‚” lzhe above species
aro all placed in the genus Aarophorus of Presl, which is
founded on Aspidium nodosum of Wallich, a large growing
Fern of peculiar habib, and having no naeural affinity with
the species of Leucosteqia, its vernation being adherent and
fasciculate (sce Acrophorus). ’
