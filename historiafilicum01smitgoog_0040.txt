sporangia, to which the term paraphysis is given. In
Amphidesmiam‚ Lophosoria‚ Trichopteris, and several species
of Alsophssa, numerous simple or articulate hairs are mixed
with the sporangia„ which impart to the sori a woolly or
hirsute appearance. ,

The above is a general view of the form and position of
the different organisation of Ferns, and furnishes data for
the definition of genera and their arrangement; but as in
many instances of botanical definitions, there are always
exceptions to normal forms and position of parts, even to
the sori being· produced on the under side of the frond, as
in Polystiohum anomalum, a native of Ceylon3 in some of
its fronds the sori are as abundantly produced on the upper
side as on the under, and bear the characteristic peltate
indusium. The same also occurs in Triokiocavpe Moorei, a
native of New Caledonia. Such seems to be the normal
state of these two species even in native specimenS, as
also in plants cultivated in Kew. ⁰

3.—-0N THE GENERA ΟΕ· EARLY AUTHORS AND 'rmum SYSTEMS
01¹* CLASSIFIGATION.

HAva described the principal organs of Ferus, by means
of which genera are defined and classified, I now proceed ·
to give a brief review of the progress of Pteridology from
the time of Linnaeus to the present, noting the works of
the principal systematic authors who have from time to
time collated and characterised the genera and species of
Ferns at their respective periods.

It appears that only about one hundred and ninety
species were known to Linnaeus. These he classified

,der eleven genera—viz. : Osmunda, Onoclea, Aorostichum,
