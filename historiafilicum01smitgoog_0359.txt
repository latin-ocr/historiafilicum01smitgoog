Although the species are to all appearances few, their
wide distribution has led to the creation of above a. dozen
species, which in th'e ‘⁸ Species Filicum ” are reduced to five,
and in the ‘⁶ Synopsis '’ to one only. Their mode and places
of growth are similar to 0. aquilium among bushes or
underwood they assume a scandent character, and often
attain a great length. They are chiefly found within or

southern limit being Tasmania.
