OBS.—In my genera of Ferns (1841) Ι made the genus
Pleopeltis‚ as founded by Humboldt‚ a seotion of the genus
Phlebodium of R. Brown, but now considering that habit
assiste to define groupe of naturally allied speeieS, and as
the species of Phlebodium and those of the present group
(Pleopellis) differ entirely in habit, I deem it best to retain
the two as distinct genera.

In order to show the different views entertained by
Pteridologisfs respeoting the limits of genera, I may here
mention that Mr. Moore‚ in his “ Index Filioum,” includes
under the genus Pleopeltisx, the whole, or in some cases
part only, of the species of no less than twenty-five genera
of authore, of which he makes eight sectione, which in
most cases differ not only in habit, but also possessing· other
special characters ; I am, therefore, induoed to adopt them
ae distinet genera.

The following are the prinoipal species that represent
Pleopeltis as here restricted. The greater number are
nativee of the West Indies and Tropioal Ameriea, the three
first are natives of the Eastern Hemisphere.
