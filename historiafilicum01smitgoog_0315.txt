'rrae 17.—SAccot.0MnAE (mato 17).

Vernation uniserial sarmentose, rarely fasciculate. Sori
marginal. Speoial and accessory indusium forming marginal
exserted or sub-marginal cysts, containing the sporangia.

OBS.—As stated under Dialowm‘ae I deem it best to cha-
racterise the following genera as representing a distinet
tribe, the sarmentose habit of growth being quite at
varianae with that of Dioksoniae. The number of species
amounts to about forty, which are widely distributed
throughout the warm and temperate regions of both hemi-
*sphereffi growing on the ground, rarely epiphytal, the
greater number of speeies being retained in the genera
Denmtaedtia and Microlepia.

Davallia sp„ Hook. Sp. Fit.

Vernation ereet or sub-decumbent. Fronde 4 to 6 feet
long, pinnato, smooth ; pinnae linear lanceolate, acuminato,
8 to 12 inehes long, serrated at the apex. Veins simple,
rarely forked, direct, parallel, free. Sori punctiform‚ con·
tiguous, laterally ooalesoing and forming a compound‚
marginal, continuous line of sori. Special indusium small,
transverse, elongated‚ sub-scyphiform3 accessory ones uni-
versal, formed of the continuous reflexed margin.

OBS.—This genus is represented by probably two speciest,
the typieal speeies being a very elegant Fern, a native of
the West Indies and tropical Amerina, having resemblance
to Pteris lonqzj’olia and P. moluocana, with which its reflexed
