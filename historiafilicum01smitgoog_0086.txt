less distance apart, and in an alternate manner on the sides
of the progressing axis, the foot or base of attachment of
the frond forming with the node a distinct and well marked
articulation or joint, which ultimately becomes the point of
separation of the mature frond, the node remaining per-
manent in the form of a round more or less elevated
cicacrix. This mode of growth includes all Polypodiaoeoe,
as restricted by me to the tribes Oleandroe, Davalliae, Poly-
podeoe, and Platycereoe. To this mode of growth I have
given the name Eremobrya‚ and in characterising the genera
the words vernation articulate are employed, and the pro-
gressing axis from which the fronds are developed surculum.
The number of species referable to Eremobrya, however,
are few in comparison with those which possess a very
different mode of growth. If, for example, a plant of
Laeti-ea Filiae-mas be examined, the fronds will be found to
be successively produced in a spiral manner from the apex
of the stem, in the form of a corona or crown‚ and thus by
successive development the stem is increased in height.
All Ferns developing fronds in this manner, even the
smallest‚ the axis of which does not rise above the ground, to
losty tree Ferus, belong to this division as also a numerous
class which produce fronds similar to the above, but which
form a decumbent stem lying on the ground or but slightly
¹¹inclined upwards. This Ι term vernation fasciculam docum ·
bem, and the preceding vernation fasciculam ereot. Another
mode of growth is common to many Ferus, such for
example in Pteria aquilina, Laeti-ea serra, Polybouya omun-
daoea, the fronds are normally produced alternately, in a
single series, from the apex of a decumbent or creeping
stem (sarmentum). In some cases this mode of growth
resembles that of Eremobrya, but from which it is quite
distinct, and is readily known by the vascular structure of
