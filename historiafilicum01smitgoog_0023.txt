but the different views entertained by botanists, respecting
the data on which genera and species are founded, renders
the study of Ferns a task of no ordinary labour. This is
owing to many causes, one of which is found in the fact
that many species are normally heteromorphous 3⁴ separate
plante of the same species presenting different forms at
the same or at different periods of growth‚ although grow-·
ing under the same climatic influences 3 in some cases dif-
ferent fronds of the same plant, and even portione of the
same frond when seen apart, have been characterized as
distinct species, and have even been placed under different
genera. It also-frequently happens that two or more speci-
mens present sufficient characters to be considered distinct
species, but when the intermediate gradatione of the
series are supplied, only the most extreme states of any
of 'the forms appear sufficiently distinct to be so con-
sidered. It osten happens that plants of the sanie species
at one time produce all simple, and at another time all
pinnato or more highly divided fronds3 it is therefore not
surprising that different forms of individual species should
be viewed as representing two or more species when
known only from incomplete herbarium specimens.

It must also be borne in mind that the descriptione of
many species found in books are derived from dried speci-
mens, obtained in various parts of the world by trade
collectors whose object is often only pecuniary gain, and
whose profits are dependent on the number of forms found.
Great cantion is therefore necessary in accepting a collector’s
idea of species3 it is only on the word of the independent
and truly scientific collector that we can rely for correct
information on the various aspects assumed by individual
species growing· in regions far away from where we write
their history-3 but· even under the most favourable circum,-
