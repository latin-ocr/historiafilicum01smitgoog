belonging to this genus; they have a wide geographical
range ; extending from the arctic to the antarctic circles,
and abonnding in the tropics, ascending to great elevatione.
Its most common representatives are forms analagous to
the Polypodium aculeatum, Izinn. (Aspidium, δια), of the
Enpropean flora, of which there are several states found in
our own country sufficiently distinct to be considered
separate species by some botanists, though others view
them as only different states of one variable species. A
similar difference of opinion exists regarding the foreign
forms, the original discoverers having named and described*
plante from different localities as distinct species, and,
indeed, in many instances they seem sufficiently distinct
to be readily acknowledged as such, but on collating a
general collection of specimens and regarding them from a
Darwinian point of view, it is difficult to consider the great
majority of them otherwise than as climatic conditions of a
single species3 and the same may be said of the group
represented by P. coriacewm. The difference in some of the
extreme forms is, however, so obvious, especially when
living examples are examined, that it seems reasonable to
distinguish them by different names, and I therefore, after
much consideration, think it best to enumerate them under
the original names given by authors.

As a genus, Polysticlmm is technically distinguished
from Lastrea by its indusium being circular and peltate,
instead of reniform, as in the latter. This character,
however, cannot be invariably depended upon, for in some
species with the habit of Polystichum have reniform in-
dusium, and instances occur where peltate and reniform
indusia are found on the same frond. To determine the
genus, it is therefore necessary to study its habit. As a
*eneral rule, Polystichum may be known from Lastrea by
