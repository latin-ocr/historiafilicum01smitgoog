Polypodium, sp„ auct„ and Hook. Sp. Fit.

Vernation uniserial, sarmentum slender‚ filiform, elonga-
ted. Fronds distant, 1 to 3 inches high, linear, gramineous
serrate or pinnato, opeque, rigid. Sori punctiform or
slightly oval‚ terminal, solitary in each segment.

Type. Polypodium fallax, Schlecht.

Illust. Mett. Polyp„ t. 1., f. 4 to 6.

OBS.—The above character comprehends three very small
Ferus, specially differing from each other by the fronds
being simple and grass like in one, serrate-pinnatffid in
another, and pinnate in the third, but agreeing so closely
in their mode of growth and structure, that I deem it best
to associate them together as a. distinct genus, and this I do
the more readily in consequence of their not possessing,
either collectively or individually, direct affinity with any
other genus.

These three species are very local, the first being found
in J amaica, the second in Columbia, and the third in
