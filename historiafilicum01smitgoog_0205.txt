omnemne or ramus mn unum, 169

Jamesonia cannot be considered otherwise than a truly
aberrant genus ; according to my view ihs nearest relation-
ship appears to be with Gymnoqramma‚ and its revolute
indusaeform margin seems to warrant its being placed in tho
present secffion.

78.-P1.ncosouus, Fe‘e (1851).
Cheilanthes sp. Hoolc. Sp. Fil.

Vernation fasciculate, erect, acaulose. Fronds sizipabe,
lanceolam, l} to 3 feet high, bi.t1·ipinnatifid‚ densely pilo-
squamose; pinnae numerous, contiguous, sessile, linear
lanceolam, 4 to 6 inches long 3 pinnules oblong lanceolate,
ὲ to {- of an inch long, laciniately lobed, lobes small,
margins , inflexed‚ forming cucullabe scariose universal
indusia. Veins forked‚ obscure3 venules free. Sporanqia

OBS.-··'I'his genus is founded on a solitary species, a
naizive of Mexico. It is a Fern of peculiar aspecls, pos-
sessing characters thala makes its relationship doubtful.
The muliaifid and squamoso fronds point towards Notho-
chloena and Cheilanthoe, but from which it differs in having
lateral, intramarginal sori, which are involved in numerous
hair-like scales, and which, being included under the indu-
saeform margin, seems to indicate iias affinity with Allo-sorus ,-
under these circumstances I deem it best to place it in the
present section in proximity to Jamesonia.
