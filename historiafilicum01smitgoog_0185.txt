110 other poinlz of relacionship with that genus, its whole ’
habit and sfiructure resembling Goniopteris and 8169110-
yramma, while from Manis-cium it is distinguished only by
13116 111016 zig-zag anastomosing of 13116 venales, Although
it thus differs from 1311666 genera only in degree, I never-
theless think it desirable to adopt it as a genus.

Tribe 8.-GRAMM1T1DEAE (mate s).

Fronde varying from simple 130 decompound multifidi, and
from a few inches to several feet in height. Veins free or
anasbomosing. Sari linear, free or united, discal ; sporangia
superficial or immersed in grooves, naked or included under
an universal indusium.

OBS.—According 130 the “ Synopsis Filicum’' this ssribe,
. as restricted by me, contains about one hundred species,
13116 greater number being represented by the genus Gymno-
9ramma. In some genera of sshe section Orfftoqramma the
sori are very 0110113 and even, nearly punctiform 3 the
reasons for ressaining such in this tribe are specially notified
under the genera of that section.

Φ Grammitideae is represenized in all Fern regions, especially
within or near 13116 131ορ108.

Samus l.—- Veins anastomosinq in various way&

Sect. L—Hnmomrmm.

Venation uniform‚ reiiculated, or 13116 venules parallel and
angularly anastomosing‚ near to, or at the margin only.
