OBse—'I'his tribe consiste of nearly 100 known specieS,
typically represented by the genus Cheilwnthee‚ as origin-
ally characterised by Swartz. 1, however, include under
it a number of species of Pteris of early authors. In most
Oheilantheoe the sporangiferous receptacles are free, not
transversely connected as in true Ptemle, but there are
’ apparent exceptione to the correctness of this distinction3
there being instances of the normal punctiform sori of
some species of Pellaea so united and seaoed in the axis of
the indusium, thus scarcely differing in technical character
from Pteria. The smooth, polished, and generally firm
texture of the fronde coincide, however, more with the
species of Cheilanthes than with Pteri33 Ι, therefore, deem
it best to retain them in the present tribe, as being more
their natural affinity than the tribe Pterideoe.

With regard to the genera of Ghoilantheoe as here
restricted, Ι must own there is much difficulty in defining
their limite, as derived from the technical character of

their fructification alone.
