indusoid margin also agrees, but the technical character of
the sori distinguishes it.

In “ Ferus, British and Foreign,” I have described the
vernation as erect, as shown by a young plant cultivated at
Kew‚ received from Dominica, which agrees with the words*
“ fronds tufted‚'’ as given in the “ Species Filicum‚'’ whereas
the specimen in the Kew Herbarium collected in Jamaioa
by Purdie is marked “ Rhizome creeping 3 this singular
Fern grows or rather climbs to a height of 20 feet.” Of
the correctness of this I have doubts; fiarther observafi0n
is required to determine whether the two known species of
the genus differ in their vernation‚ there being no specimens
of the fronds attached to the caudex in the Herbarium.
