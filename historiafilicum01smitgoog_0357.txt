As a genus Lonchibis is distinguished from Iattobroohia by
the sori being seated in the sinus of the lacinae, thus form-
ing a semicircle or crescent, and also in the pubescent
character of the caudex and fronde.

In the “ Species Filicum '' six species are described, but
which in the “ Synopsis '⁹ are reduced ·to one, a new
described species is, however, added, namely, L. occidentalia
Baker. 'I'he following species appear to me to be specifi-
cally distinct, two of which have been under my notice in a
living state.

L. aurite, Iam. (12. Lindemann, Hook.) (v v.) ς L. pubes-
cens, Willd. (v v.) ς L. Natalensis, Hook.

The first is a native of Mauritius, the two latter of
Mauritius and Natal.

Pteria sp. auct„ Hook. Sp. Fil.

Vernation fasciculate, erect. Fronde long stipate, pin-
nato, 2 to 3 feet high ; pinnae pinnatifid, the lower pair bi-
partite, or with one or more pinnules on the inferior side 3
lacinae linear oblong, falcato, entire, or serrulate. Veins
forked, the lower pair of venules anastomosing‚ forming a
straight arcuate costal arch between the bases of the lacinae,
the rest of the sterile venules being free, the apices of the
fertile combined, forming a linear, transverse, marginal
sporangiferous receptacle, seated in the axis of au inflexed
linear, special indusium.
