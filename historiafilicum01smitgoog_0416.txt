more ideal than actual. But, for the sake of convenience,
Ι admit {she necessity of following tho usual praclzice of
authors, and consequently adopt the genera as herefofore.

In at leasb &wo species the fertile fronds are contracted
into a linear entire or racemose rachiform spike, and upon
this character Bory founded two genera, Hymonostachys
and Feea. The first of these has the peculiarity of bei-ng
the only species of Hymenwhylleae having anastomose
veins3 and that circumstance, in conjunction with the
conta-acted form of the fertile frond, induced me in 1841 to
adopt it as a distinct genus, which Ι still conuinue to 'dor
In Feea the venation is free, and it consequently differs
from 'Drichmnasnes only by the contraction of its fertile
trond, so thala Ι did not at the same 'period regard it as
distinctu but upon reconsidering the subject, Ι see no
reason why Feea should not have as good a right as
Lomaria to be considered a distinct genus, it having the
same relationship with Trichomavoes that Lomaria has with
Bleolmum.

In the preceding observatione I have mentioned the
chief points of structure employed by authors for classi-
fying the species3 and, although I have given the subject
much consideration, Ι can find no other tangible characters

whereby the number of genera may be advantageously
increased. This is, however, differenfi from the view taken

by Presl, who arranges the whole under no less than
twenty-three genera, as stated at page 30. A eritioab
review of these so-called genera would occupy more space
than can be afforded in the present: work, and would serve
no practical purpose. The characters of his new genera
appear to me fo be in many cases imaginary or derived
from imperfecl: materials, the same species being in some
cases placed under separate genera.
