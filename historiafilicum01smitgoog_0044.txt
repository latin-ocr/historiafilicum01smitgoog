these works a number of new genera are characterised, bub »
it is not necessary bo enter ini-,o furssher details regarding
them here, more especially as the principal of them are
given hereafter, either as accepted genera or as synonyme.

These authors were followed by Ο.Δ Sprengel, wh0, in tho
fourth volume of his “ Sysbema Vegetabilium,'' published in
1827, brought together and arranged in systematic order
the whole of the species of Ferns known bo him. Although
this work cannot be looked upon otherwise lahan as a
hasty compilation, and is of little value as a work of
reference, yeb it has the merit of bringing into a brief
compass a descriptive enumeration of all the Ferus known
⁰ ab that period, collated from previously published works;
the hobal number of his circinabe Ferns being 1‚309‚ which
he arranges under fisty genera. This shows that a con-
siderable increase of species had taken place since the
bime of Willdenow, and a glance ab the author’s names
above mentioned proves that the study of Ferns had not
been neglected.

The discoveries of Blume and Reinwardt in Java, led to
the publication in 1830 of Blume’s enumeration of the
Ferns of thab and other of the Malayan Islands, in which
460 species are described. Of iahese 300 were new, the ’

whole being arranged under fisty genera, six of which were
previously unknown.

This was followed by the splendid folio work, Blume’s
“Flora of J ava,'' which contains finely-coloured platee
of Ferns3 and in the letter press he gives many new ideas
respecbing genera. At this period Link and Kunze
published several treatises on Ferns, the first an enumera-
