Pteria aquilina marks it as a type of a small group, distinct
from the preceding· genus, and as such it is further distin·
guished by the presence of what is supposed to be an
interior indusium, of which the author of the‘ ‘Species
Filicum’' says, “Easily as the outer involucro of Pieris
aquilina is to be seen, even with tbe naked eye, the muer
one, except in a peculiar state of the sorus (before it is
mature) can only be brought to view by careful dissection
under the microscope. I have, however, satisfied myself
of its existence, though Ι have osten failed to detect it3
indeed the fact appears to be ignored by ‘the most distin-
guished writers on Ferus.” My observation on this point
is, that there is to be seen in the early stage of the sorus,
rising from the. interior side of the receptacle, a narrow,
thiu, elevated fimbriate ridge, but which in my opinion
cannot be considered a special indusium analogous to that
of In‘udsaea, and more especially as it is soon obliterated by
the growth of the sorus. However, a more evident interior
indusium is to be seen in Pteris qlutinosa, a Fern of special
habit, having alternately branched decompound fronds,
agreeing in general mode of growth with Pteris aquilina.
In this the sporangia are seated as it were in a slit, similar
to that of Isindsaea, but, although such is the case, I cannot
view the interior lobe of the slit otherwise than as a
thickened lamina. It is, however, a specially marked cha-
racter, and it is supposed to be the Fern described by St.
Hilaire under the name of Peneia, which Mr. Moore adopts,
and places it in his section Dioksowteae, next to Gibotium, but
with which it has no natural affinity, and cannot be well
separated from Pteria.
