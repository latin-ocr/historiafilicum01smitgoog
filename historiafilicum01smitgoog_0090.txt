1 'have also to notice that articulation is not confined
to the stipes alone; the segments of fronde—laciniae,
pinnae, and pinnules—being in many instances articu-
late with their respective rachis, whether primary or
secondary. This is particularly characteristic of the
genera Drynaria, Arthromeris, Schellolepis, and Photinu-
ptcris in Eremobrya3 and NephrolepiS, Isoloma, Didymo-
chlaemz, Cystodiwm, and others ⁴in Desmobrya, as also in
Scaphobrya.

By payin g attention to these points they are found
serviceable in determining the natural affinity of species.
Several of the above genera, as also Arthrop tem, Garato-
pteris, Platyoevdum, and Amphiblestra, possess characters
peculiar to themselveS, which necessitates their considera-
tion as aberrant genera ; consequently the nature of their
fructification, venation‚ and habit, must be conjointly
viewed in determining the tribe to which they seem most
naturally to belong.

On taking a retrospective view of the preceding obser-
vations‚ it will be seen that every defined form of the
organs or structure that serve for defining genera, whether
artificial or natural, are liable to vary more or less from
the adopted typical normal form, and thus afford ample
scope for Pteridologists to name and classify genera

 

according to their views of the value of the several ·

organs. On this point two authors seldom agree; „hence
great confusion is introduced into the nomenclator of
Ferus. Some may ,be called conservative, such as Hooker
and Mettenius, who maintain entire the old genera of
Linnaeus and Swart23 while others, as shown in the pre-
ceding pageS‚ break up these large genera into a number
of smaller ones.

These different views are consequent on there being no
