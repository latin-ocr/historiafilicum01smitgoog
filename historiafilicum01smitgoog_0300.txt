Oea—The general habit of the species of this genus
agree in every respect with Gyathea, and are only dis-
tinguished by the technical character, which consists in the
indusia of Alsophila being either absent, small, scale-like, or
forming a nearly complete cup.

In my Genera. of Ferns, 1841, 1 arranged the species of
A lsophila under two sectione, the first Hymenosteqia, including
those having a membraneous indusium, very small in some,
but in others forming a nearly complete cup, differing from
Cyathea. only by not completely surrounding the base of the
receptacle, there being always an open sinus on the exterior
side ; and the second, Trichosteqia, those in which the mem-
’ braneous indusium is entirely absent, the sporangia being
more or less covered with articulate hairs.

Although thirty years have elapsed since that mode of
⁶arrangement was published, · and having observed much
during that period, I find Ι can make little or no alteration
in it, except by amalgamating the genus Gymnosphera, of
Blume, with Alsophila, of the species of which Ι now form
a third section, characterised by the sori being destitute of
a membrane and of hairs, in that respect not technically
distinct, except in the arborescent habit, from Pheqopteris‚
to which it is otherwise related through the genus Lopho-
soria.

In the “ Species Filioum '’ sixty-three species are described,
of which about a dozen are marked dubious, the “SynopsiS,”
however, enumerates ninety species including the Appendix.
They are widely dispersed over both hemispheres.
