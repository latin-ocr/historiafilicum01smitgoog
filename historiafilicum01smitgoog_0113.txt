OBS.—In my “ Genera of Ferus,” 1841, 1 noticed the
peculiarity of the species in the preoeding genua, and also of
this, but then did not deem the characters sufficient to
separate it as a genus from Polypodium. Later observa-
tione, and the views of both Presl and Fee, induce me now
to separate them from true Polypodiums.

Sp.—C. obliquatus (BL), (Beda. F. Brit. Ina. pl. 167),

7.—Tm1.A00PrER1s, Kze. Herb. (1856).
Polypodium, sp. Blume. H'ook, Sp. Fit.

Surculum slender. Fronde distant, stipate, linear, pinna-
tifid, membraneouS, smooth, 1 to 2 feet high, 2 inehes
moed, laciniae articulate with the rachiS. Veins once
forked, venules free, the exterior branch soriferou&
Receptaozes punctiform, terminal, deeply immersed in a cyst,
. forming· elevated papillae on the upper side. Seri trans-
verse, uniserial near the margin of the laciniae.

Type. Polypodium papillosum‚ Blume.

Illust.—Bl. Fl. Jav„ p. 191, t. 88. Horsf. Pl. JaV. Rar„

p. 6, t. 2.

OBS.—Finding that the Polypodium pupillosum of Blume
does not well associate with any of the species of Polypo-
dium as here restricted, Ι therefore deem it best to follow
Kunze in adopting it as a distinct genus. The forked
venation distinguishes it from Promptia and Gryp tosorus3
and the deeply-impressed receptacles and the articulation
of the segments with the rachis from true Polypodz‘um.
