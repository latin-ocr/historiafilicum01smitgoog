Osa—The Ferns comfituting this genus are readily
known from all others b y their climbing habit 3 the fironds
being permanent, and increasing in lengizh indefinitely by
their twining and interlacing with one another, and with
other plants, they form impervious thickets. The various
forms they assume, and the divisione of the fronds, render
it difficolt to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion as bo the
number of distinct species. Presl enumeratos forty species,
but in the ‘⁴ Synopsis Filicum ’² only sixteen are described,
which I consider bo be nearer the brue number of distinct
species. 'l'hey abound within the tropics‚ and extend to
New Zealand in the southern, and Β. palmatum extends to
Oanada in tho northern hemisphere.
