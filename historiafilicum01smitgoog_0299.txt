sori with Alsophila, 1 refer them to the Hymenosteyia section
of that genus, restricting Hemitelia to about a dozen speeieS‚
which are readily distinguished from Alsophila by the lower
venules anastomosing opposite the sinus of the lacinae,
but in some species this character is wanting, the whole of
the venules being free3 their habit of growth and broad
divisions of the fronds is indicative of their relationship to
be with Hemitelia rather than with Alsophila ; it, however,
must be admitted that although the typieal species of
Gyathea‚ Hemitelia, and Alsophila, warrant their separation
as distinet genera, the transition species however appears
to unite them so as to form one natural group. The
species as here restricted to Hemitelia, are all natives of the
West Indies and Tropieal Amerina.
