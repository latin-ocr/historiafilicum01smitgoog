Asplewdwn lucidum.

A Fern with pinnato shining fironds, 2 or more feet in
length. By the New Zealanders it is regarded as a sacred
plant ; it is used by their priests when praying over a sick
person ς holding a frond of it in his hand, he waves it over

the patient, and if it happens to break it is regarded as a >

fatal omen. Before engaging in any war-like enterprise,
it is also waved in the same manner whilst offering up
prayers to the spirits for success ; if it breaks it is supposed
the gods are adverse to their engaging in war. When the
chief has his hair cut, he holds a frond of this Fern in his
hand, and when finished the priest takes it and waves it
over his head, and at the same time prays3 it is afterwards
dipped in water, and shaken over the chief ’s head3 if the
frond does not break it is considered to indicate long life,
but if it breaks it is regarded as a sign that he will not

live long. It is also used as an emblem of mourning.
