Archeqowia differ considerably in their structure from the
Antheridsca, they consist of bottle-shaped cells into which
the spermatozoids have been seen to enter, and are
supposed to fertilize the embryo contained in the cells, the
result being the production of a young plant on the upper
surface of the prothallium‚ as above stated. According to
what is now explained a prothallium is monoecious, in some
mses supposed to be dioecious. The latter having recently
been found to be specially the case with the prothallia
of Omandeoe. This singular d'iscovery has excited con-
siderable interest among physiologists3 and has been care-
fully investigated by several, especially in this country, by
the late Professor Henfrey, as recorded in ‘⁶ Isinnean
Transactions,'' vol. xxi, 1853. Recently considerable
attention has been paid to the subject by M. Ε. Meyer,
Inspector of Garlsruhe Botanic Gardens, who in the
“ Gartenfiora '' for February, 1875, gives his practical

. experience regarding raising Ferus from spores, He says

he has only succeeded in raising one plant of the genus
Gleiohenia, G. dican-pa, and one plant of Mamilia, M. lati-
fobia,* and that he has failed in raising Hymenophhylleoe,
which he accounts for by the meist nature of the fronds‚
and 13116 speres bursting in the sporangia soon losing-
their vitality by becoming dry.

Much investigation is, however, required before many
circumstances attending· the germination of spores can be
explained, such as, why the Desmobrya division does, as a N
general rule, increase the abundance of spores, even to
some species becoming weeds 111 the hothouses3 while, on
the other hand, those of the division Eremobrya are com-
paratively few.

⁴* This, however, is no rule, for about 20 years ago numerous plants
of Marattia cioutoefolia were raised from speres at Kew.
