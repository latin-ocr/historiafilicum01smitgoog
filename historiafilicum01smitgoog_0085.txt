older or more perfect fronds of izhe plant, or different
planias of izhe same species, it is anastomose. In some
caseS‚ however, the normal structure of the venation is
partly anasbomose and partly free, as in {she genera G‘om'-
opteris, Nephrodium‚ Hemitelia, dvc. In these genera ‘che
lower or basal venules of each parcel are anastomose,
while iahe upper are free. In some genera, such as Adian-
tum, Lindsaea, and Asplenium, the venai-,ion is normally
free ; anastomoses occasionally occur in different segments
of the same frond, but such seem more accidenfial {aban
normal.

From what Ι have now stated ib will be seen that neither
the form or position of the sori or venation‚ the absence or
presence of indusium, taken singly or combined, can be
depended on for determining natural genera. Such being
the case, and having had under my notice examples of
nearly l,OOO species of living Ferns, has led me to the con-
clusion that in order to form natural genera the different
modes of growbh must be taken into account, that is the
manner in which the developing axis (caudex) increases‚
its direciiion, and the mode of evolution and attachment of ⁸
the fronds. I find that Ferus present two very distinct
modes of growssh, which are comparatively as distinct as
Exogeus are from Endogens. My views on this subject
first appeared in the “ Botany of H. M. S. Herald,’' pub·
lished in 1853, but as that work may noi. be accessible to
all engaged in the sbudy of Ferns, I will repeat the sub-
stance of what is there given.

If Polypodium vulyare be examined,i1·‚ will be seen that
its frenels are produced singly from the sides of a creeping
progressing stem, which has ihs accrescent apex always in
advance of its young developing frond, each successive frond

being produced singly from special nodes formed ab more or
