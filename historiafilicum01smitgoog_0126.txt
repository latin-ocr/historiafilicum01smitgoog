Ona—The species of this genus agree with Phymatodes
and Pleuridium, but differ in the nature of the caudex, and
the fronds of the greater number of the species being thin
s and fluonia, as also in tho irregular disposition of the sori.
ἱ With Selliquea it is connected through Ο. membranacea,
in which the punctiform sori are united, forming linear
oblique soti, which character has led the author of the
‘⁸ Species Filicum ’' to place it in Gymnoqrmnma. The
irregular afrangement of the sori is also conspicuous in
0. samaram ,ἰ in some fronds the sori are punctiform,
while in others the receptacles unite, forming linear, or
even transverse continuous sori, and also at the same time
punctiform sori. 'I'his apparently double character induced
me to elevate this species to the rank of a genus, which in
1841 Ι characterised under the name of Diblemma, but
later observatione have shown me that it cannot with pro-
priety be separated from the present group.

'I'he genus consists of about sixteen species, all natives of
the Eastern Hemisphere‚ extending from Western Tropical
Africa through India, the Malayan Islands, China, Australis,
and Polynesian Islands.
