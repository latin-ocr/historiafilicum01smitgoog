OBS.—This genus is founded on a solitary specieS, a
native of Venezuela and Mexico, which in general habit
agrees with Polybotrya, but is distinguished by the venules
being combined, forming oblique elongated areoles. In
general the sterile fronds are pinnate, with nearly entire
pinnae3 but in cultivated plants fronds are often produced
with deeply laciniated pinnae, similar 'co the states observed
in Olfirsia. In these specimens the veins of each of the
lacinae are partially thickened‚ and more or less united3
and often towards the apex of the frond the lacinae show
some degree of contraction, and produce distant round
masses of sporangia on their apex or margin, thus showing
that the fertile fronds are only a highly contracted state of
the sterile.

laciniately lobed, bulbiferouS. Veins pinnate3 the lower
venules transversely anastomosing, forming elongated costal
and sub-costal areoleS, the exterior venules firee. Fertile-

OBS.-—This genus consists of a single species, a native of
the ⁴Malayan and Philippine IslandS, which to a certain
extent in the character agrees with the following genus,
