confluence linear naked.

OBS.—This tribe consists of about 200 described species.
The greater number come under the genus Polypodium, as
characterised by early authors, that is in having puncti-
form naked sori. The greater mass of the species have
anastomose venation, from simply reticulated to compound‚‘
with free veinlets terminating in the arecles. In many
cases this difference alone is not sufficient to define natural
genera ; to do so it is necessary to make habit and any other
special structure of the fronds an important character in
arranging the species into natural groups, which, on
account of the gradual transiticn, it in many cases becomes
difficult to determine the group in which the transition
species should be placed. Authors are much divided on
this point, for instance, the venation of Phymatodes as
characterised by Presl, I in 1841, considered it did not
differ from the earlier founded genus Drynaria of Bory,
while Moore, in his “ Index Filicum‚'’ places the whole of
Presl’s Phymatodas, with the exception of the section Dry-
naria, under the early named genus Pleopeltis, also in-x
cluding under it the whole or a portion of the species of no
less than twenty-four genera of different authors, Of
Drynaria of Bory he says, “ We have kept separate the
very distinct-looking little groups of Drynaria and Dip teri-3,
the former distinguished by its peculiar sessile, sterile
frondes, the latter by its peculiar dichotomo-palmatafid
fronds, rather perhaps than by differences of higher value.”
After having carefully considered the different views of
authors, and having had examples before me of the greater
number of known species, I have been led to arrange the
tribe Polypodeae as, follows :——·
