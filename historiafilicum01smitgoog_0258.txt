or connected, this specie8‚ wsth several others, including
Goniopten‘s Sandvioeme and its allies, seems to form a
natural group, which, with Lastrea villosa, may, on the
character of general habit, be viewed as forming a natural
genus of sub-arboroid Ferus.

ons—This genus was first noticed by Brown in Hors-
field’s “ Planta J avanica‚’' and about the same time de-
scribed by me in Hooker and Bauer’s “ Genera Filicum ”
under the name Sphoerostephanon. Later observatione have
led me to view ila as scarcely distinct from Nephrocbium,
with which the species agree in habit. The only difference
that Brown and myself considered as generic consishs in
the sori being oblong linear, and furnished with an
elongated indusium attached along the contre of the soruS‚
having the appearance of being double, like that of some
species of Athyriwm, but in Mesahzaena it is in a single
piece. and cannot be viewed otherwise than as a lengthened
reniform indusium of Nephrodium fitted to the lengthened
