Ome—The species forming this 3611116 616 nativos of the
1116616111 hemisphere, and were originally included by most
authors under Polybotrya3 but 66 11116γ do not well 6666-
616116 111 habit with the original species <ff that genus, I
therefore adopt Schossb's 3611116 E'qenolsia. At least 6131111
species have been described as belonging to this group‚ but
astoer comparing specimens representing the different
species, the 31661161 number of them seem to me to be only
different forms of one or tw0, or at most three, species.
The chief differenee is in the pinnae‚ which are entire or
more or less laciniated‚ and the whole seem to run into
6116 another.
