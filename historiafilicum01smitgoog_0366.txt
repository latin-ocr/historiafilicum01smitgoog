“ Synopsis” of the above work, the number is reduced to
seventy. With a few exceptione sshey are stemless, gene-
rally caespibose, with smooth glossy fronds, a few only
being slightly pilose or furnished with glands. The
greater number have free venation, but anastomose vena-
tion characterises Woodwardia and its allies.

Vernation fasciculate, coespibose, often stoloniferous‚ or
solibary erema, sub-arborescenb. Fronde simple, pinnatifid
. or pinnate, from a few inches to 4 to 6 feet: high3 pinnae
adherent or rarely ‘articulabed with the rachis. Veins
forked3 tho sterile venules free, or their apices thickened
and forming· a cartilaginous margin3 the veins of the
fertile pinnae combined near their base by a bransverse,
conbinuou5‚ sporangiferous receptacle, constitussing a linear,
constal, or rarely extra-costal sorus· Indusium linear, plane.

Type. Blechnum occidentale, Lv‘mn.

OBS.—-In the ‘⁴ Species Filicum'' forty species of Bloch.
num are described, but in the ‘⁴ Synopsis Filicum '’ they
are reduced bo eighteen.

Great confusion exists in the synonymy of this genus
with that of Lomaria, the most obvious distinguishing cha-
racter being in the fertile fronds of the latter being con-
tracted‚ but Ι must admit that this distincbion is not always
definite, it being difficult bo determine 1·,ο which genus
certain intermediabe forms belong, and, bo make sshe matter
worse, Presl characterises the species of Blechnum under
