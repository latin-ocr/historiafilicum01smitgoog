species being arranged in natural groups, which are now
by most authors ranked as genera. They are distinguished
from the preceding and following tribes by the sporangia
not being produced in defined, round, or linear masses (sori),
‘but closely occupying the whole of the under side of the
fertile fronde or segments, which are often contracted into
rachiform spikes or panicles. By this contraction the
venules are brought so close together that in many cases
they seem to be entirely wanting, the whole disc becomes
a sporangiferous receptacle; but in others this is a character
of degree only, the contractiori being often more or less
definite in the same frondi, there being instances of the
veins being evident and sporangiferous, this variation has
led to the different states being characterised by some
authors as genera. Setting aside the contractiori of the
fertile frond, and the amorphous sori, many of the species ’
agree in natural habit and venation with genera of the
tribe Pheqopterideoe‚ which will be specially noticed under
the respective genera.

the margin, or reticulate.

Vernation uniserial or fasciculate. Fronde simple, entire,
sessile, or stipitate‚ from 2 inches to 2} feet long, smooth or
squamoso. Stipes often pseudo-articulate. Veim simple or
forked, their apices free and clavate. Fertile sronds mode-
rately contracted, the under side wholly sporangiferous.
