Although ἡδο sporesofmanyspecies germinstein pro-
fusion, it osten happens ἡδηὴ no plant bud is formed, even
under ἡδο most fivoureble circumstances of ahuospheric
hest md moisture. This failure of plant bud may be
pofflly duetothe sporesbeiug, sseboveststed, uni-
sexnnl, und therefore productng only dinecious pmthsllis.

The time required before the spores germinate varies
greatly, some ffing eighteen months, othere two or three
weeks. Some species of Gymnoqmmma and Gha'lanties
germinateinssmanydays, whfler-aimaimiqniswill
germinate in ss short a time ss forty-eight hours. Few
pmthallis of the letter, however, produce plante, while, on
the other haud, oeratopisris thalictroidoe germinatas
quickly and produces sbundsnce of plante, even becoming

Of late years some intermediete forms of species, espe-
cially ofthe genus Gymnoymmma, heve beenraisedin
gardens, which are by some called sports or hybrids,
whether such is simply the effect of cultivation, or by the
prothallis. of two distinct species being so contiguous to
one another thet the spermatzoids of the one have the
power of passing and fertilizing the archegom‘a of the
other, thus genereting hybrids, ss in flowering plante. In
general prothellis produce only s. single bud, but on ἡδο
bud being removed it is succeeded by others, end thus as
many ss eight or ten young plante have been produced
from a. single prothsllium of Hymodium crinitum; but
what is even still more singular, is, that by ‹hviding the
prothallia from the base upwurds into two or even four
parts, each part produces s plant bud. An explanation
of this, as also of many other points conneooed with the
subject, is yet to be discovered3 for instance, in 1830,
