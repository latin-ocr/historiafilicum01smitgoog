section Hemidictyum, along with the two species of Asple‘ni-
dictyum and H emidictywm marqmatum, all three very dis-
tinct in habit. Although I now place Ceterach after Hemi-
dictyum it is not that Ι consider it has any relationship‚
but- merely on account of having no ally for it, I place it
as an anomalous genus at the end of the tribe.

Sp. O. officinarum, Wizld. (v v.) (Gr-amonim, Sw.; Scolo-
pendrium, Sm.).

OBS.-—Found in rocky places, and on old walls in this
country, and throughout Europe and the temperate regions
of the N orthem hemisphere generally· In Madeira the
fronde attain a large size, and which by some authors has
been described as a distinct species under the name of
Ο. aureum.

B. Βίης of Sporanqia horizontaz, central.
Sect. L—Sori discat, pwnctzfform, nahal, rarely indusiate.

Tribe 24.—GLEICHENEAE. (Plato 24).
(Gleicheniaceoe, R. Br.) ,

Osss.—This Tribe includes a peculiar group of FernS,
consisting of about thirty described species, technically
distinguished from Polypodiaceoe by the sporangia being
surrounded with a horizonta] ring generally at right
angles with the axis of attachment. This direction of the
ring is common to the whole of true Gleioheniaouae, but in
Matonia it is partially oblique.

Independent of the structure of the sporangia‚ Glecclae-
niaceae are readily known from all other Ferns by their
fronds being once or many times dichotomously branched

or flabelliform (two species excepted, which have simple
fronde).
