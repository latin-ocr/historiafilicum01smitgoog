Osa—The genera founded by Sir William Hooker, of
which there are five, are marked with an asterisk, and the
number of species named and described by him in the
“ Species Filicum '⁹ amounts to aboulz 600.

In a notice at the end of the fisth volume of the “ Species
Filicum,’' he states, thaiz “ if his life and health be spared
ω him, he intends ω woompfish a volume to be ent-‚ifled
‘ Synopsis Filicum‚’ to contain brief characters of the sec-
tions, genera, and species of Ferns‚ general habitans, and
references bo {zhe ⁴ Species Filicum,' omiti-‚ing all really

Marattiaceae, and Ophioqlossaceoe,” which it is hoped will
form “ a useful vade mecum for the fravelling botanist‚
and the cultivator of Ferus, and for ready consultation in
the herbarium.''

Only one part, wil-‚h the preface of this work, consisting
of twenty-two peges, was printed at iahe time of the
author’s death (which took place in August, 1865); the
remaining manuscript was placed in sshe hands of Mr.
J. G. Baker, who, shortly aster Sir W. Hooker’s death,

forming a volume of 482 pageS, which was published in
1868, accompanied by nine coloured plates illustrating the
characters of tho genera, of which there are seventy-five.

In iahe arrangemeniz of the {zribes and genera this work
does not differ materially from {zhe ‘⁶ Species Filicum :⁹¹ the
number of species described of Oleicheniaoeae and Poly-
podiaceoe amounts to 2,122, being 279 less than the
“ Species Filicum‚’' while 106 are enumerated under the
sub-orders osmundaceoe, Marattiaceae, and Ophioqlossaoeae‚
