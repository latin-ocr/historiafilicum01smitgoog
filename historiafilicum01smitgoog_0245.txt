ΟΒ8.-’1Ὶιίει genus was, until lately represented by a
single species, as yet found only in the Island of Trinidad‚

West Indies. It is so similar in habit and venation with

Dryomenes and Podopeltis, that without a very close exami-

nation of its sori it would pass for a species of Dryomenes,

allied to D. plan'taqinea, but the sori are found to be
furnished with a. small membraneous' calyciform indusium,
similar to that of Woodeia.

In the “ Species Filicum '⁹ it is placed in the Tribe

Dicksonioffi with which it has no affinity either in habit,

venation‚ or position of the sori.
