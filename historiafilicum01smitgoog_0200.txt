OBe.--Hitherto the species of this genus stood under
the tribe Pterideoe, but the eporangia being borne on free
veine, and as they agree in habit and general aspect with
Α Navoa, I therefore deem thie section their natural place;
but I must remark that several species of the genus Pezzaea
have a strong claim of relationehip with Platyloma, and
are only distinguished from the latter by the sporangia
being borne on the combined apices of the veins, forming· a
continuone sorus 011 the axis of the indusium, ae in true
Pieri-³.

This genus consiste of about a dozen species, widely
distributed, being· represented· in Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa, as aleo tropical and temperate North America.
