OBS.—This genus is founded on a very rare Fern, hitherto
only found in the Moluccas and New Guinea. On account
of the sporangia being seated in a marginal groove, analo-
gous to that of the tribe Lindsoeeoe, consequently it has been
by authors placed in that alliance3 but it differs entirely
in habit and texture, and in having no membraneous
indusium. Fee has very properly characterised 113 as a
distinct genus, and places it in alliance with Toenitis, with
which 113 has some points of affinity in texture and venation,
but it differs in the vernation being articulate, that of
Taenitis being adherent.
