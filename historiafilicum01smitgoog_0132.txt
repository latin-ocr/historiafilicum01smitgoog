OBS.—'I'his genus was originally founded on an abnormal
state of a very remarkable Fern, having fronds of different
forms, one stabo having simple and sinuoso fronds on the
“ same plant, known as Polypodium sinuosum of Wallioh.
(Hook. Sp. Fit„ t. 274); the more perfect state being a
Luzon plant, which, in my “ Enumeration of Philippine
Island Ferus ’⁹ (1841), Ι named Drynaria lomarioicies, which
has equal pinnatifid fronds, and as in Polypodium vulqare,
the pinnae occasionally become laciniam& each lacinia
bearing a single sorus, and being concavo, presente some
similitude to the fructification of the Liohen called Leoanora‘
(Nephroma) resupinata. Besides these characters, the very
remarkable thick soaly rhizome marks it as a very peculiar
Fern, worthy of being considered a distinct genus.

The different states have been found in J ava Peninsula
of Malaeoa, Borneo‚ Philippine and other easbern islanda.
