L. villosa (Sw.) (v v.).

This is a native of the West Indies and Tropical America,
and is described by the collectore, Wilson and Purdie, as
having fronds 10 to 18 feet in length3 the height of the
stem is, however, not stated. In 1864, two plante in the
Kew collection received from J amaica, were producing fronds
5 to 6 feet in length, rising· from a thick caudex, which
had every appearance of in time becoming arboroid.

Although this species techm‘cally agrees with Lastrea in
venation and character of the sori, the large fronde, and
arboroid character of its stema, seems sufficient to warrant

its being worthy to be ranked as a distinct genua.

Sect. 2.—Vernation samntose. Fronde more or less dietant
(sselypteris).

OBS.-- In the “ Species Filicum '’ this is made a synonym
of the preceding, but I consider it sufficiently distinct to
rank as a species, It is a native of South Africa, while L.
palustris is a native of Europe.
