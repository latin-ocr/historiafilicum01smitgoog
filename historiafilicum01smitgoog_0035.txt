primary veins, they thus become parallel with the costae,
and are then called transverse. In many cases the venales
produce veinlets in an irregular manner, which either anas-
tomose, or terminate within the areolos. When directed
outwards they are termed excurrant, and remora-ent when
directed inwards3 this is termed compound anastomose
venation. In many cases, both in free and anastomose
venation, the apices of thav-anulos and veinlets is thickened
(clavate) in the form of a gland.

REO EPTAGLES.

The receptacles are the sites upon which the sporangia
are 'seated, and are generally thickened points, or length-
ened portion of some part of the venation. In position
they are called terminal when on the apex of the veins οι·
their branches3 lateral when on the sides of the veins3
axillary when on the forking; compital when on the
angular crossing or points of confluence of two or more
venules or veinlets. They are superficial or immeo-sed in
the substance of the firond, or elevated above its surface, and
then columnar οι· globoso. When in the form of a point
or dot they are termed punctzform‚ and, when lengthened,
elonqated or linem,- and amorphous when of no defined
form (as in Acrostichum).

SPORANGIA.

The spore cases or sporangia are the organs which con-
tain the reproductive spores, and are borne in masses upon
the receptacles. They are thin and transparent, or horny
