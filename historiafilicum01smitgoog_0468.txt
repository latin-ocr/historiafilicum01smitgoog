Oibotium Barometoe.

A native of China and Tartary. 'l'he fronds of this Fern
are bipinnate‚ and rise to the height of 10 to 14 feet, pro-
duced from a decumbant and progressing caudex, which is
densely covered with long light brown silky hairs (charac-
teristic of the genus), when old looking like wool, and
when lying on the ground having the appearance of a
wool-clad animal. 'l'he story told to early travellers led
them to describe it as a plant of flesh and blood. ‚The
travellers’ tale upon the subject is, that on an elevated
plain of vast extent, in count-‚ries east of the Volga„ grows
a wonderful plant, with fihe shape and appearance of a
lamb, having feet, head, and tail distinctly formed, and ilas
skin covered with soflz down. The “lamb ” grows upon a
stalk about 3 feet high, the part by which it is sustained
being a kind of navel ib turns about and bends to the
herbage which serves for its food, and when tho grass fails
it dries up and pines away. The real facts are that the
caudex of this Fern is decumbenb, progressing in length
a foot or more according to age, and is 3 or more inches
in diameter. Its woolly appearance has led it to be likened

lto a lamb, the native name for it being Baromet-z, and by
travellers the “ Tartar-ian lamb,’' and others “Aquas Say.

Το make the story plausible the natives turn the woolly

stipes upside down, cutting away the fronds, leaving a
portion of the lower part of the stipes, four of which serve
as legs, and thus tho resemblance to a woolly animal is
complete, and, being so manipula-ed, much resembles a

weasel.
