In this and other countries the fronde are cut and dried‚
and used for many domestic purposeS, such as thatching‚
and for protecting vegetables and tender plants from fiost,
and the young fronds are given to swine. The fronds are

· burned in large heaps, and the ashes contain a considerable

quantity of alkali, which is made into cakes or bans, which
form an article of trade, especially in Wales, and are used
as soap in washing, it is also used by glass makers. The
whole plant contains a considerable amount of tannic and
gallic acids, and its astringency is such that in some
countries it is used for tanning leather.

,Many medical properties have been ascribed to it, but
with the exception of being used as a vermifuge its many
extolled virtues are now obsoleto.

It is, however, an important food 'ferm its creeping
underground stems contain a quantity of starch and muci-
lage, and are used in some parts of Europe and other
northern countries for mixing with meal to make broad,-

cakes, forms a coarse but palatable food.

In 1857 it was again brought into notice by Mr. Ben-
