Acoeaeory indusia are formed of 15116 entire margin of 15116
hond, or a portion of 115 being changed in texture and form
and inflexed‚ its margin conniving with 15116 free margin
of 15116 interiorly attached special indusium, 15116 two thus
combined forming a continuone or interrupted groove,
opening exteriorly. When 15116 special indusium is pro-
duced on a punctiform receptacle, an urceolate, bilabiate, or
tubular cyst is formed, which contains‘ 15116 sporangia, some
being exerted beyond 15116 margin (pedioellate); while in
some cases 15116 cysb is antcmarqinal‚ and is 1511611 termed
cucullata, in all these cases opening exteriorly, 111115 osten
more or less turned inwards‚ and 1511611 having 15116 appearance
of being on 15116 under side of 15116 margin.

Universal indusia occurs when 15116 segmenbs of the fertile
fronde ιιι-6 conti-acted. They consisb of 15116 margins of 15116
segments being more or less changed in texture, becoming
membranous, and folded inwards (involuw), the two
opposite margins generally meeting, and thus enclosing all
15116 sori upon 15116 segment‚ whatever may be 1511611· form or
position upon the veins, the- segments 1511116 assuming 15116
form of a pod or siliqua (siliquvffomn) as in Struthiopte‘mln
or of a berry (baomfhrm) as in Onoclea. ’

111 some Polypodeoe 15116 sori are furnished with scales of
various forms3 in Pzeopeltis they consist of numerous
orbiculat· peltata scales, imbricato over one another, and
covering 15116 sporangia of each sori 3 in Hymenolepis they
are very 1511111 and membranous 3 in Lopholepis 15116)Γ 661161615
of numerous slender scales, longer 1511611 the sporangia ; in
Schellolepis they are irregularly laciniaized3 club like and
6151161· forms are also common 156 15116 genera Vittaria and
Toenitis. Such bodies are considered to be imperfect
