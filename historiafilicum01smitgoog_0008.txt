Indian specimens presented to me in 1829 by tho
late Dr. Wallich, which led ‘to my commencing a
Fern Herbarium, that firsb received a special addi-
tion in the form of a collection of Jamaica Ferns,
coUected in that island by Mr. Roboris Heward.

In Ι 1841 Ι purchased a set of the great. collection
of Ferns made in the Philippine Islands by Mr. Hugh
Cuming3 of them Ι drew up a list, published in
Hooker’s “ Journal of Botany.” Ι then wrote a
Memoir, entitled, “ An Arrangement and Definikion of
the Genera of Ferns‚” which was read before the
Linnaean Society, and published in Hooker’s “ Journal
of Botany for 1841-42.” In 1842 Hooker and Bauer’s

“ Genera Filioum '³ was completed, whereiu, 1 described

twenty new genera.

Collections of dried specimens vere occasionally
‘placed in my hands· for naming, among which may
be mentioned Schomburgh’s “ Ferns of Βιὰἱῑίεὴι Guiana,”
published in Hooker’s “ Journal of Bossany ’⁹ for 1842.
The “Ferns of New- Zealand‚” iu Dr. Hooker’s “ Flora
of N ew Zealand,” in 1854. Ferns collecfied during
the voyage of the surveying ship “Horam'’ by Dr.
Seemann, conssained in the volume of* the Botany of
