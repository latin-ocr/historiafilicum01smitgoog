genera under two division& The first, which he terms
‘⁴ Nuda? consists of six genera, characterised by the sori
being naked, that is destitute of indusium, by some termed
qymnosoru83 this division contains 167 species. The other
genera being furnished with an indusium he terms ‘⁴ In-
duciatesss’ which comprehende 467 species. These two
divisione embrace all Ferus which have their sporangia
furnished with a vertical ring ; as also the genera Hymen-
ophyllum and Trichomues, in which the ring is horizontal.
The next systematic arrangement of Ferns appeared in
1810, in the fifth volume of the “ Species Plantarum ” of
Willdenow, wherein 1,010 species of circinate Ferus are
described, comprehended under forty-one genera, being an
addifion of five new genera. since Swartz. Three of these

new genera are founded on species retained by Swartz in '

Linnean genera, the other two (Polybotrya and Pleopeltis)‚ are
each founded on a single species, for which the authority of
Humboldt and Bonpland is given. As the characters upon
which Willdenow founded his genera do not bring forward
any striking new feature of structure, beyond certain modi-
fications in the nature of the indusia and contraction of the
fertile frond, I do not deem it necessary to speak further of
them in this place. The first pictorial work at that period
was the “ Kryptogamische Gew'achse '’ (plants), by Pro-
fessor Schkuhr, of Wurtemburg, published in 1809 ; it is a
quarto volume containing 196 finely executed coloured
platos representing 263 species of circinato Ferns, and
accompanied by 212 pages of descriptive text. The im-
portance of this work is manifested by the fact that all
succeeding pteridologists quote the figures as evidence in
the identification of species.

The above were followed by special works and miscel-
laneous writings in journals on Ferns, the principal writers
