work consiste of quarto platee, each plats illustrating a
genus by figures, showing a portion of the fronde natural
size and also magnified, in which the anatomical structure
(venation) and the form and position of the sori and other
parts of the fructification are distinctly shown, each plate
being accompanied with descriptive letterpress. At the
time of the author’s death, only forty platee of this prac-
tical and usefnl work were published.

With the works of Schott and Brown commenced a new
era in the history of Pteridology. It is, however, to Pro-
fessor Presl‚ of Prague‚ that the credit is due of being the
first 130 publish a general systematic arrangement of
genera founded on venation‚ which appeared in 1836 in
1116 celebrated work entitled “ Tentamen Pteridographeae.’'
In 1311613 work about 1,500 species of annulate Ferns are
enumerated (exclusive of 13116 tribes Hymenophyllece and
Omnwzdeae), which he classifies under 115 genera arranged
under two sub-orders, technically distinguished by the dif-
ference in the direction of the ring that surrounds the
spol-angium. The first he 13611116 Ηεῑίοοᾳῃναιαε, which is
characterised by 13116 ring being horizontal or more or less
oblique with its point of attachment, it contains two tribes,
viz. z—Gleicheniaceae and Gyatheaoeae. the first of which has
five genera and twenty-three species3 the second eight
genera and twenty-four species. The second sub-order is
termed Gathetoqyratoe, and contains all Ferns in which the
ring of the sporangia is vertical.
