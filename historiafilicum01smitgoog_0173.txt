Ona—This Iasi: is a naizive of Now Zealand, and very
variablo in the form of its fronds3 in what may bo tex-med
the perfect simae, tho pinnae aro lanceolato, and 2 to 3 inchoa
in length, whereas in the varioizy formed pimpinellaefolia
they are numerous, small, and nearly round, not exoeoding
a quartor of an inoh in diameter.

With rog-ard to L. leptocarpa, it is peculiar in having a
thickened baso to the stipes, analogous in appearance to
the ari-‚ioulabe nodo that characterisos the division Eremo-
brya. Foe describes it as “frondibus articulafis.'’ My ·

own observation, however, is that it is not jointod with
tho sarmentum.

Vernatio‘n uniseriaL sarmenboso. Fronds distaniz, bipinna‘to,
3 to 4 fooiz high, pinnae alternabe, 6 to 8 inches long, patent,
articulate with the rachis3 sterile pinnulos contigimus,
twenty to thirty pairs, obliquely oblong, ᾖ inch in length,
short potiolato and articulabo wiizh the rachis, which is sub-
alate. Veins forked, free. Fertile pimules linear falcabe,
smallor than the sterile, the under disk wholly spot-angi·
forous.

Type. Polybotrya articulata, J. Sm.

OBS.—Tho Fern bearing tho above character being so
different in general habit from true Polybotrya, Ι am inducod
to separato it as a distinciz genus. The ari-‚ioulato pinnae
and pinnulos disfinguishos it from Polybotrya, and the
bipinnahe fironds from Lomariopsis.
