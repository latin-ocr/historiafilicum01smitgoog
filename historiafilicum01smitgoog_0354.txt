Ona—In habit the species of this genus are similar in
general appearance be those of the following genus Pteris,
but are technieally diefinguiehed by their anastomose vena·
tion.

The species vary greatly in eize, in the circumscription
of bhe fronde, and in their mode of growth3 oecasionally,
indeed, separate parias of a single frond differ eo widely that
in labe herbarium they are apt to be viewed ae distinct
