OBS.— This genus was originally founded on specimens
of a Fern from the Philippine Islands‚ which I afterwards
found had been previously described by Blume under the
name of Leptochilus lomaroidea In general habit it agrees
with Gyrtoqo‘nium as now restriobed, but the numerous and
eurious peltate scales that cover the sporangia marks it as ς
a distinet genus3 it was originally supposed by me that
the marginal sori was its normal character, but this is

now found bo be due bo the fertile pinnae being only par-
'tially eontraoted.

¹* F ronds pinnate.
