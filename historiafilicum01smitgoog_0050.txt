now being constituted of species separated from the well-
known genera M arama, Anqiopteri3‚ Danoea, the technical
characters of which are, however, so slight that I do not
consider them worthy of adoption.

Of Oomundaceae he describes twenty· four species, two of
which he characterises as a new genus under the name of
Leptopteri3‚ but' which I consider not worthy of being
separated from Todea of Willdenow.

Of Sohizaeaceae he enumerates sixty-five species, arranged
under eight genera, three of which are new—Lophidium,
consisting of fiv9e species separated from Schizaea, and the
two others upon a single species each, founded upon doubt-
ful and even mistaken data, one of them (Spathopteris)
having no other authority than a figure of Plumier’s
“ Filices‚” which, in my “ Geumi Pniaum,”.pub1ished in
1841, I show to consist of a barren and fertile frond of
evo distinct Ferus.

With regard to Lyqodiaceao he describes forty-one species,
thirty-nine of which belong to the genus Lyqodium of
Swartz‚ and two to Hydroqlosswm of Willdenow. The
number of species of the three latter genera are also ¹in
excess‚ Anemia alone having thirty-eight.

In 1848, Dr. Presl published another work, entitled
“ Hymenophyllaceae‚” in which he describes 185 species,
which had hitherto been comprehended under the well-
known genera Trichomanw and Hymenophyllwn, but of
which Presl makes no less than nineteen genera3 and in
his “Epimelia Botanica '' he characterises three more,
making twenty-two in all, about one-third of which are
founded upon a single species each. The data upon which
these genera are founded is derived chiefly from the size
and form of the cellular parenchyma, and the slight modi-
ficatione observable in the form of the indusium and
