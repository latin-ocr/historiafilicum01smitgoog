of growth and venatica, but with the exception of five
species of Platycerium he' retains the whole under the
genus Acrostiohum.

Of the tribe Asplenieae he describes over 300 specieS, all
comprehended under the genus Asplem'um, except two
species which constitute the two genera Allantodia and
Antinopteris. 'With regard to Scolopendriwm‚ some authors
consider it as a genus scarcely separable from Asplenium,
but in the “ Species Filicum'’ it is characterised as a dis-
tinct tribe under the name of Smlopendrieae. It consists of
nine species, which agree in general habit with Asple‘nium,
and present no special character to justify their separation
as a tribe from Asplenieoe.

We give another instance, —in speaking of H ypoderrw,
he says :—“ Considering as I do that the primary divisions
should be taken as much as possible from the fructifi-
cation, I have no hesitation in placing Hypoderris among
the Dicksonioe and near to Woodsiass‘ No three genera
can be more distinct in natural affinity than these—that
is, as regards habit and anatomical structur03 the only
similitude is between Hypoderm and Woodsia, which have
discal punctiform sori, with a very membranous cup
indusium, therefore in that character are more properly
though artificially related to Gyathea than to Dicksonia‚
which has marginal sori with cystiform indnsia opening
outwards.

Again, take the case of Matonia, a rare Fern with fan-
shaped fronds, in every respect allied to Gletohenia in
habit, and also in the ring of the sporangia being hori.
zontal, and differing only from Gleichonia in the sori being
furnished with an inverted cup-shaped indusium, attached
by its centro as in true Aspidmm and, Polystichum.
Although such is the case, Sir william Hooker follows
