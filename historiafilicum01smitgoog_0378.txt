Oss,——'I'his genus, as here restricted, consiste of a solitar-y
species of peculial· habit and somewhat doubtful relation-
ship. In my Arrangement of 1841, and previously (1838),
in a note at tab. 82 of Hooker and Bauer’s “ Genera
Filicum‚” Ι stated that the membraneous scales found inter-
posed *between the confluent sori were truly special laterally
attached indusia‚ and I therefore placed it in proximity
with Aspidiwn‚ thus removing it from the vicinity of Blach-
παθη and Woodwardia‚ where it originally stood, but later
and more careful examination of the natural affinities of
Ferus, has led me to place it again in the tribe Bzeohoaeae,
its nearest ally being the genus Low-ameria.

In the “ Species Filicum ” the genus Struthiopteris is
united with Onoolea, but it is quite at varianae with Onoczea
technically as well as in habit.-
