OBS.—-'I'his genus as here restricted consists of eight
known species of truly arboreus FernS, some attaining the
height of 20 or more feet, the trnnks of some becoming
much enlarged by a coating formed of outgrowing aerial
rootlets. They have a wide geographica] range, the typical
species being found only in St. Helena, one in J ava, one in
Tropical America‚ one in J uan Fernandez, Fiji, and New
Caledonia, two in New South Wales and Tasmania‚ and
three in N ew Zealand.* In habit and general appearance
they resemble Cyathea, but as a genus they are technically

* In the Addenda to “ Synopsis Filicum ” three new species are
described, two found 111 New Caledonia and one in F iji and Samoa.
