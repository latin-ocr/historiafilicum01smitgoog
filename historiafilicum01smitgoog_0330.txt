different forms of one species, -·In the “ Synopsis Filicum ’³
a fourth species is described as belonging to this secfiion‚
under the specific name of “Miohzerianass’ a native of New
Granada. It is described as being pinnato, 12 130 15 inches
in length, izhe pinnae 3 to 5 inches long, the veins forming
hexagonal areoles, with free included veinlets, which seems
to indicate its affinity with Diciyooeiphium3 its mode of
vernabion is nob described, and probably when that is
known it will be found not to belong to this tribe.

Ona—The species on which this genus is founded differs
in general appearance from izhe brue species of Schizoloma,
and especially in the pinnae being articulate with the rachis.

11: appears to be a rare Fern, as there is no specimen in
the Hookerian herbarium3 but the nature of the stipes of
fronds in my herbarium²¹¹= induces me bo believe it bo have
articulate vernafion.

The presence of whibe dots on the upper side of the
pinnae gives it some claim to be ranked with Isoloma and
NephrolepiS, but till more of it is known I retain it here.
