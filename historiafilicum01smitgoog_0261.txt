sometimes so deep as to give the indusium a bi-lobed
character, while in others it is scarcely evident and the
indusium is then nearly orbiculat and thus characteristic of
Polysticlmm. In the ‘⁸ Species Filicum ” Lastrea ranks only
as a section of Nephrodium ,- the author thus not admitting
the difference between anastomose and free venation to be
of sufficient generic value to wal-rant the separation of the
two groups of species; in the section Lastrea 115 species
are described, in the ‘⁸ Synopsis '’ the number is raised to
153, of which 65 have Mr. Bakers initials affixed, and in
the Appendix 46 species are enumerated‚ a few of which
are for the first time described as new species, but the
greater number consiste of removals from Aspidium, the
specific name being changed in many cases.

Laeto-ea as here restricted contains about 100 species, of
which 65 have been examined by me in a living state.

The difference in the position of the sori and forms of the
indusium has led to the species being arranged under a
dozen or more genera by different authors, none of which
have sufficient character to warrant their adoption.
