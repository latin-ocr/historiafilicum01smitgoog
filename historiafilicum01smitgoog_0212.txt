Ons.-'1*his genus is abundantly represented throughout
the tropics and sub-tropical regions of both hemispheres‚
generally growing on trees, their pendulous linear fronde
looking like bunches of grass. A considerable number
of species have been described by different authors.
They differ very little in general appearance, the most
obvious difference consisting in the sporangia being seated
either in a slit of the margin open exteriorly, or in a groove‚
formed by the margin being involute. In my “ Genera of
Ferns,” 1841, Ι separated the species possessing the latter
character from Vinaria, and characterised them as a genus
under the name of ToeniopsiS, which I afterwards found
was synonymous with Haplopteris of Presl. Since then I
have examined numerous herbarium specimens, and find it
difficult in many cases to place them under the respective
genera, and as there is no difference in general habit, and
no practica] advantage gained by the separation, I have re.-
united them, and given⁴ up Toeniopsis as a genus.

M. Fee has adopted the same course in his memoir of
this genus, published in 1852. In that work he describes
twenty-five species, eighteen of which are exemplified by
figures. In his descriptions he attaches much importance
to the fronds being membraneous or coriaceous, andto the
mid-rib being more or less evident, but on comparing the

‘gures with one another and with specimens, they appear
