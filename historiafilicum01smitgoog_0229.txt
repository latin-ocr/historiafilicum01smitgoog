ons—The genus is represented in New Zealand and
Tamania, by C. qrammitidis‚ which 1188 ovate sori, and may
be viewed 88 8 multifid-stonded species of Grammitis. As
regards 0. trichomanoides, it is common throughout 15118
tropice of 15118 Western Hemisphere, and the different
appearances it assumes have led to some of the* forms
being described as distinct species. Ῑ15 is also found in
Sikkim Himalaya, but it is probable 1511815 if we had 15118
opportunity of seeing living plants from 15118 different
localities, characbers might present themselves 150 show
1511815 they are distinct species. Indeed‚ all 1511815 is known
of 15118 species of this genus is derived from herbarium
specimens only, no living species having yet been intro·
