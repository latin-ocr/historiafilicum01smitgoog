¹ differenees, I have thought it best to adopt the following
arrangement.

⁸In general habit the Gyathcae may be viewed as analogous
to those speeies of Pheyopteris and Ῑιαεύνεα, having terminal
vernation, and large compound fironds rising from an ereot
caudex, and as some have naked sori, and others a lateral
indusium not differing from that of Lastrea, the arboreous
‚habit and elevated receptacles are, therefore, the only points

that technieally distinguish them, but, in some cases, even, .

the elevated reeeptaole fails.
The apparent obliquity of the ring of the sporangia in
Gyatheae has been already explained at page 41.

OBS. With regard to this genus Mr. Brown remarks in
the “ Prodromus Florae Novae Hellandiae,'’ that, besides the
genuine species of Oyathea, characterised by having the sori
seated on the fork of the veins, there are others from
Malaooa, which have the sori seated on the middle of the
mins, which distinction 1 find normal to at least three
specieS. It is, however, observed that in several speeies
of true Cyathea the sori are seated a little above the
