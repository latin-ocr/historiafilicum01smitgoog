Oea—This genus was founded by me in 1841, on the
Lmdsaea laaninosa, of Wallich, a native of the Mauritius,
Malayan Peninsula and Island83 to which Ι have since
,added two other species also natives of the same regione. In
habit and general appearance Isoloma lammqinosa is similar
to Nephrolepie ensifolia and Ν. hirmtula, but differing
in the sori, being contiguous‚ forming a line on both mar-
gins of the pinnae, and in having a continuous indusium
opening exteriorally, in that respect agreeing in technical
character with Lindsaea, but the articulated pinnae and
central costa is at variance with the character of that genus.
Its affinity with the present group is also indicated by its
having the white chalky dot, characteristic of Arthroptem’deae.
