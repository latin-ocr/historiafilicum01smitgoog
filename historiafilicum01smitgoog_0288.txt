Europe inhabiting only Alpine situations. One species is
found in South America and another has been discoirered
in Southern Africa, and one in J apan.

As originally characterised, Woodsia comprises only
three species, which are not only peculiar in their singular
capillary indusium, but in their stipes having a distinct
articulation some distance above its base. This latter
character is similar to the elevate-d node of Oleandra, but
otherwise the technical characters of the two genera are
quite different.

ln the section Physematium, the indusium is so truly
calyciform, that, in determining affinities from that organ
alone, they (with fronds only a few inches high) would
be associated with the arboreous genus Gyathea, and
on account of the sori of W. caucasica being apparently

marginal, led' to its being first described as a species of
Dickzonia.
