With such a wide range many species have been described
by authors on very slight characters, chiefly in difference
in size, for instance, in Moore’s Index 55 names are recor-
ded, of which only twenty-one are adopted as true species,
and thesein the “ Synopsis Filicum” are reduced bo sixteen.
In many Asplenieae, plants while young and small produce
fructifioaffiom and have been considered as distinct species,
such is the case wis-,h Antrophyum nanum, Fee (A. obtusum,
BL), which is described as not more than an inch in length,
but on collating numerous sets of specimens it is impossible
to come to any other conclusion khan that the intermediate
sizes‚ even from the smallest 'oo 2 feet in length, are only
the graduations of a single specieS, the differ-enee being
consequent-a on age and climatic influences. The principle
of creating species of Antrophyum upon difference of size,
might with equal justice be applied to the common Harts’-
tongue Fern (Scolopendrium officincirum)‚ fronds of which
may be found in fiuctification from a little more than an
inch to two feet in length.

The species vary in the sporangia being immersed or
superficial, of which the following are examples.

ὓ Sporanqia immersed.

mersum, Bory.,· A. planssagineum‚ Kauls.‚· A. Cumingii,
Fee (A. latifolium, Reinw. non ΒΖ.) 3 A. reticulatum, Kaulf. ,-
A. semicosssat-um, ΒΖ.

*²* Spora‘nqia superficial or sliqhtly immersed.

A. ensiforme‚ Hook. (Ic. Pl„ t. 394, Second Ueni. t. ⁹70);
A. lanceolatum, Kaulf. (v v.) ; A. Cayennense‚ Kaulf. (v v.);
A. latifolium, Bl.,· A. Boryanum, Kaulsq· A. giganteum,
