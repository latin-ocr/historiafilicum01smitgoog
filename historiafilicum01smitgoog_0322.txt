Microlepia adiantoides, and that again with several species
of Denmtoedtia‚ a gradual transition 'is seen to connect all.

Fit„ l, t. 30, R).

OBS.—The latter species is a native of Peru. In the
“ Synopsis Filicum ’' another species is described, namely, ,
D. Moorei, which, although agreeing in having an exserted
cup-like indusium, is nevertheless quite distinct in habit
and venation. In this work it is characterised as a genus
under the name of Trichiocarpa.

Tabe 18.—L1NDSAEEAE. <Plato 18.)

Vernation sarmentose, slender‚ elongated‚ or short and
caespitose. Sori marginal, linear, continuous or interrupted,
binate or punctiform. Special indusium plane, attached on
the interior side, equa] with, or shorter than the indusaeform
margin, forming a marginal groove‚ or bilabiate cyst‚
open exteriorly.

OBS.—-A very interesffing tribe of Ferns, in many res-
pects similar in habit to Adiantwm‚ but readily distinguish-
able by the indusium being attached on the interior side of
the receptacle‚ and open exteriorly. This character,
however, is not sufficient of itself for technically distin-
guishing Lindeaecae from the tribe Sacoolomeoe, but their
distinct habit marks them as representing a separate
‘group.
