OBS.—The species on which this genus is founded was
originally described by Presl.‚ in his Bel. Haenkeanae, as a
species of Diplazium; but his original specimen having
come into my possession, with the addition of otherS,
clearly shewed that the sori were destitute of indusium,
having the true character of Gymnoqramma, but differing
in the venation being anastomose, this led me to characterise
it as a distinct genus under izhe above name.

N atives of Malayan, Borne0, and Polynesian islands.
Besides the usual pinnato fronds of S. pinnata it also
produces simple fronds, which in the specimens seen by.
me were sterile3 they are, neverizheless, extremely like
the Hemionitis lanceolata, described and figured by Sir
W. Hooker, in the Second Ceut. Fern, t. 55, buia the
venation is more uniform reticulated and wholly sporangi-
ferous, as in true Hemiom‘tis, I am, however, inclined to
consider it a state of S. pinnata.
