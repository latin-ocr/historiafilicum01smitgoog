the stipes being continuone and intimately connected with
the portion of the stem forming the internode between the
fronde, from which they cannot be separated without lacera-
tion. In these three modes of growth—that is, whether
the fronds are produced in a fascicle, forming an erect or
decumbent axis, or in a single series—the principle of at·
tachment is identical, and there being no articulation‚ as in
Eremobrya² the bases of the stipes are so united and become
indurated, forming the solid portion of the stem. To this
mode of growth I have given the term Desmobrya, and
in the definitions of the genera the venation is termed
adherent.

The various modifications of Desmobrya Ι have found
useful as auxiliary characters in indicating natural genera,
but there are exceptional cases of species of Lastrea and
Nephrodium‚ with erect fasciculate vernatiom not distinguish-
able by the character of their fronde from other species of
the same genera with decumbent uniserial vernation;
nevertheless the adoption of the vernation and the nature
of the accrescent axis as part of the definition of genera is
of much assistance in determining the relative affinities of
many genera.

In general the difference between Eremobrya. and Des.
mobrya‚ as above described, is obvious, and there can be
no doubt that the two modes of growth are specially dis-
tinct, the plants being endowed with very different natures‚
the vital power and tenacity of life, and power of resisting
drought being much stronger in Eremobrya than in Desmo-
brya 3 and it is not a little remarkable that so far as obser-
vatione upon cultivated plants enable me to ascertain, the
latter are much more freer reproduced from spores than
>the former. It is also worthy of notice that in the
importation of Ferus from distant countries, those of
