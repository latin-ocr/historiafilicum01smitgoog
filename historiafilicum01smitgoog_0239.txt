Ona—This genus was established by Fee upon the
Polypodium menisciicarpon of Blume‚ in which the sori are
generally oblong and curved, but such I consider to be an
abnormal form of punctiform sori3 I, therefore, in the
“Bot. Voy. of Hera1d‚” added a second pinnato specieS, as
also the Polypodium plantaqineum of Linnaeu8‚ all of which
agree in habit and venation, and in having naked sori, the
latter being· the only character that separates them from
true Aspidium.
