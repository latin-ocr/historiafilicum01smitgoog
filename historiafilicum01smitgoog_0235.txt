“ they are epigeouS, of a flaccid sofb texbure, easily affecized
by drought3 the well-known Imma Filias-mae, L. Oreop-
teris, and L. dilatata being examples; or they are more
firm, hard, and spiny, as in Polystichum aculeatum and
allies.

The most important divisional characbers consist in the
veins being free or anastomosing in various ways, and in
the sori being naked or furnished with an indusium, which
in some is very small and fugacious, soon becoming obli.
terated, and which leads 130 some species being placed in
indusiabe genera by some authors, while others place them
among the non-indusiato. ’ . '

The normal character of 13116 indusium is either lateral
(interiorly attached) or peltate3 in some multifid firondS,
such as Lastrea deparioides, the indusium appears 130 coincide
with the orenule or dent of 13116 margin, so as 130 form a
cyst similar 130 that of Mioerolepia, and in Triohiocarpa it is
exserted beyond 13116 margin in the form of a calyciform
cyst, as in quwia. In Amphiblestra t-he sporangia are
produced in an irregular row close, 130 the margin, which
is inflexed in the form of an indusium like that of Pieris,
but from which 113 differs entirely in habifi and venation,
which is that of Aspidium5 and as regards Isoloma,
although 113 has marginal sori similar 130 Isindsoea, it never-
theless differs entirely in habit, which agrees perfectly
with that of Nephrolepis. In Hypoderris the sori are
discal and furnished with a small membraneous calyciform
indusium similar 130 that of Woodsia. x Although these four
genera differ in the nature of their fructification from the
normal character of the indusiato Pheqop tem-ideae, I never-
theless deem it best 130 place them in it, and as near as
possible in contiguity with the genera 130 which they are
mosb nearly allied in habit and venation,
