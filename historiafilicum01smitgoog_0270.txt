Ona—'rme genus is founded on a solitary Foru, which
differs from all free-veined Aspideae in its fronde being cor-
date, sub-entire, or more or less lobed‚ and of a thick,
comnenus, firm texbure, and obscure vein33 its peculiar
habit induced me to characterise it as a distinct genae,
under the name of PachyderiS, but which is superseded by
the earlier one of Fee. It may be considered as holding a
position intermediam between Polystiehmn and Lastrea.
