Ona—At page 227 of the “Bot. of Voy. Herald,” I
described the Fern from which the above character is
derived, under the name of Utenopteris (Glyphotaenium)
crispata, and stated that 1 considered it allied to Pobypodium
scolopendroides, Hook. and Grev. and P. mspensum, Sw.‚
but from which it differs in having anastomose venation,
and its vernation being adherent, not articulate, as in these
two mentioned species ; I therefore deem it best to charac-
terise it as a distinct genus'under the above name. These
characters, and the peculiar habit of the plant, renders it
difficult to point out its true affinity otherwise than in
Otenopteris. It grows in a pendulous manner on trees in
Darien and Panama.

Sp. G. crispatum, J. Sm.

Tm'be 13.-PHEGOPTERIDEAE. (Plate 13).

Fronde varying from simple to decompound multifid.
Venation free or anastomosing in various ways. sori
punctiform or linear, naked or furnished with an indusium,
which is either lateral, peltate, rarely calyciform.

Osa—This is an extensive tribe of Ferns, comprehending
all the Pheqopterie section of Pobypodiwn and the tribe
Aspidiaceoe as given in the “ Species Filicum,’' the number
being, as reduced in the “ Synopsis,” 3663 while'Metteniuffl
in a special memoir of Pheqopteris and Aspidium, enumerates
299²& In the greater number the vernation is fasciculate
and acaulose, and in others uniserial. With few exceptions

⁴⁶ In the Appendix to Syn. Fil. sixtymne species are enumerated, the
greater number of which belong to this tribe.
