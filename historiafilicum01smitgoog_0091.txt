law of nature to mark where a genus begins or where it
ends. On this point, in my “Arrangement of the Genera
of Fern5,'' published in 1841, I have said—“A gradual

transition of form is seen to pervade through the whole, ,

not in a lineal, but in a complex reticulated manner, it
becomes very difficult to determine in which genus the
extreme or transition species of groups should be '‘placed”
On considering that in many cases habit is not excluded
in assisting to define the genera of flowering plants, and

in numerous instances it is anwed by eminent botanists ’

to constitute the chief distinction between allied genera.
'For example, the order Diliaoeoe is represented by nearly
1‚700 species, arranged under about 150 genera, which all
agree as regards their parts of fructification, the slight
variations of which are made use of sor defining genera3
and, indeed, if it was not for the difference in habit, the
number of genera are capable of being greatly reduced.
This and other instances that might be quoted favour my
view, that in order to constitute natural genera of Ferns,
habit must play an important part3 and so long as any
number of species agree in habit, and possessing other
characters in common, it matters not whether such groups
are called genera, sub-genera, or sections of genera. For
my own part, I prefer regarding them as genera, as it
saves a great deal of unnecessary trouble in speaking or
writing about FernS, it being much easier to say Drynaria
coronam than Polypodium (Drynaria) coronans, or Elapho-
9loseum conforme than Aerostichum (Elaphoqlosmm) eon-
some, or Gymnoqramma calomelanos than Gymnoqramma
(Euyymnoyramma) calomelan085 also by stndying the cha·
racter of the smaller groups individually, and treating
them as genera, their nature at once becomes fixed. upon
