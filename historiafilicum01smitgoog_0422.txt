Tribc 26.—SOHIZAEAE (Plato 26).
(Sohizeaoeae‚ Kaulf.)

Sporanqia produced on contracoed racemes or penicles, or
on marginal lobules or spikelets, oval or oblong, rarely
globose, apex sfflated, annulafiform, opening lengthways‚
vertical.

Ona—The oval sporangia, furnished with a striated
apex, analogous to a transverse ring, readily distinguishes
Sohizaeaceae from the two preceding divisione (Α. and B.)a
They were originally comprehended under omundaoeae,
and to judge by the structure of their sporangia, the slight
difference scarcely wart-ants their separaffi0n3 but as they
differ much in habit, it is deemed most natural to view
them as separate tribes.
