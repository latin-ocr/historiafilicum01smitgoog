led to the oreation of many species, one of which is L.
mayelhznica of Desvaux (Hook. Gard. Ferns, t. 52), a native
of Tierra. del FuegO, under which, in the ‘⁴ Species Filicum‚”
L. Borywna is quooed as a synonym3 but this is reversed in
the “ Sy‘nopsis Filicum.'’ The following are also treated
as synonyms of L. mayelloenioa5 L. mmmmm, Kanlf, South

L. lanuqinosa, Kze., Natal. The only living examples of
these seen by me are L. mayellanioa and L. aycadzfolia,
which Ι adopt as disffinct species3 and it is probable that
some of the others when seen together in a living state,
will also be recognised as disfinct.
