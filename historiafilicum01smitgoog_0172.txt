OBS.-—In my “Arrangement of the Genera of Ferns,” in
1841, Ι adopted Acrostichum scandens, Linn.‚ as the type of
a distinct genus, which Ι named Stenochlaena, to which Ι
also referred A. sorbifolia of Linn.‚ and A. lonqifolia, Kaulf. 3
but not long after this was done, the three species came
under my notice in a. living state, and Ι then found that
A. coamens differed from the two latter in having a. trans-
verse anastomose coetal vein like that of Bleclmum; this
'character indicates its relationship to be with Bleolmum,
the other two species being truly acrostichoid‚ and allied
to a group of fifteen species which Fee places under the
present genus; but on account of the variableness of the
forms which come under thie genus, it is difficult to
determine which are species. In the “ Species Filicum '’
no less than eighteen specific names and five genera are
given ae synonyme under AL. sorbifoh'a5 but it is quite
probable that when seen under cultivation some of these
forms may be found to be quite distinct specieS‚ of which
L. sorbifolia and L. lonqifolia are proofs. They are
widely dispersed over the Tropics of the Western and
Eastern Hemisphere‚ and also represented in New
Zealand.
