time of the publication of the “ Synopsis,” is stated to con-
tain 50,000 specimens of Ferns, representing the many
different states of the species therein described.

As might be expected from a new writer on Ferns,
many changes have been made in the nomenclature and
synonyms, as given in the ‘⁶ Species Filicum,” there being
no less than fifty of the names in the “ Synopsis” having
ΜΓ. Baker’s initials prefixed, which is principally con-
sequent on his having removed species from one genus to
another, and in many cases giving new specific names, as
also by the addition of a considerable number of new
species.

1 have already noticed that in the “ Species Filicum ''
species of very distinct habits and characters are placed in
the same genus3 of this there are several remarkable
-new examples in the “ Synopsis‚’' the most conspicuous of
which will be found noticed under the respective genera in
my general arrangement. , ,

In December, 1874, a second edition of the “ Synopsis ’'
was published, containing an Appendix to the first edition
prepared by Mr. Baker, regarding which he ‘says ‘⁶ Ι have
endeavoured in this edition to briefly characterize and fit
into their places the new discoveries and the plants found
npon fuller information to have been inadequately dealt
with in the first.’' This Appendix contains the names of
438 species, 198 of which bear the initials of Mr. Baker3
the principal authorities for the others being Mettenius,
Klotzsch, Karstein, Grisebach, Moore, and Kuhn; with the
exception of about twenty, the whole are additions to the
2228 described in the first edition of the ⁸⁶ Synopsis ;’' thus
on the authority of that work the total number of known
species of Ferus amounts to 2546.

Whether the above number is represented by truly dis-
