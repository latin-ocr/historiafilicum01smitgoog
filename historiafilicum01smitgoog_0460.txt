the general distribution of the family it is found that a
greater or lesser number of allied species are confined to
special regions, some species restricted to very small areas,
and even to special localities. q

From the above it will be readily seen that it becomes
difficult to draw up any statement of the number of species
peculiar to different countries or regions.

This subject haS, however, been fully gone into by Mr.
Baker, who, in an elaborate memoir of 47 pages quartos*
shows the general distribution of the order through the
different zones and regions, and the relation of the species
of the regions to one another 3 the data which he has
adopted are the localities given in the “ Species ’⁹ and
‘⁴ Synopsis Filicum,” the number of species recorded being
2228, which are arranged and tabulated in a form showing
the regions and countrics where each species is found, and
the speeies peculiar to each region. He divides the earth
into four zones, namely‚ Arctic zone, North temperate zone,
South temperate zone, and Torrid zone. These are sub-
divided into ten regions, of which the following is a sum-

mary, showing the total number of species, and also those
peculiar to each region.

species, none of which are peculiar to it, all being
found in the adjoining zone.
