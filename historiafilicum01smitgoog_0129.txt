Osse—This genus is distinguished from Pleopaltia prin-
cipally by the venules being more compoundly anastomose,
the fronds being smooth, and the sori destitute of indusae-
form scales. It comprehende a considerable number of
species, all, with two or three doubtful exceptione, nativos
⁴ of the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the Eastern
hemisphere.

OBS.—This is a native of British Gaiana, and is peculiar
in being an example of Phymatodes, thus showing that the
genus is not entirely restricted to the Eastern hemisphere.
It, however, may be called an aberrant species; it has a
remarkable caudex, from half an inch to an inch in
thickness, densely covered with long lanceolate, acumi-

nato, silky scales, very much resembling the well-known
Hare's-foot Fern,Dcwallia canariensis ,· the fronds are distant,
short, stipate, oblong, elliptical, 1 to 1} feet in length, and
2 to 3 inches in width, smooth, coriaceous, with thickened
margin; the sori are large, round, or oblique oblong,
forming a medial row on each side of the mid-rib. The
peculiarity of this Fern has led Klotzsch to place it under
a distinct genus, which he names Meoosorus. Another
remarkable American species is Polypodium (Phymatodes)
bifrons, Hook. “ Species Filicum,'' and Hook. Fil. Exot.,
t. 52. The character of the caudex is described as being
long, slender, naked3 the sterile fi-onds being elliptical,
3 to 4 inchoa in length, the fertile narrow, linear, 5 to 6
