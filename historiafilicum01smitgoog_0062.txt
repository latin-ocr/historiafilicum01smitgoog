side. This, according to my view, accounts for the ring
appearing not to be truly vertical, but it is to be observed
that the obliquity is not general, for in the figures of the
sporangia of eight Cyatheaceous genera' in Hooker and
Bauer’s ‘⁸ Genera Filicum,” the ring„ is shown to be verti-

cal. Ι therefore follow Robert Brown in placing Gyatheoe .

in Polypodiaoeoe.

The next systematic work to be noticed is that of
Professor Mettenius‚ of Leipzig, wh0, in 1858, commenced
publishing a work entitled “ Uber einige Farngattingen ’'
(“On Some Genera of Ferns”), of which five parts have
appeared. In order to explain this author's system of
classification of species, Ι will give a brief outline of the
manner in which he treats the genus Polypodiwm. He
enumeratos, and mostly describes in full, 258 species of
this genus, including in it all the forms possessing puncti-
form‚ ova-l, or linear, naked sori, thus restoring it to nearly
the state in which it was left by Swartz, Willdenow‚ and
Sprengel‚ and even including in it the genus Gramma of
those authors. His reason for placing so many species
under one genus is on account of the numerous interme-
diate or transition forms, which he says so pass into one
another that he finds it difficult to define any gronp of
species as a distinct genus in the manner that Presl and
others had done. notwithstanding this, however, he finds
it quite possible to divide the genera into sections and sub-
sections, of which he gives an elaborate synoptical table.
He first divides the 268 species, according to their veins,
being free or anastomose. Those with free veins are
placed under four sections, and those with anastomose
veins in thirteen sections. These sections and sub-sections
(which are numerous) in most cases bear the names that
designate the genera of Presl and others, and consequently
