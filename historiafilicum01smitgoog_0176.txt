Ona—My first know‘ledge of the singular Fern on
which this genus is founded, was obtained from a specimen
in the herbarium of Dr. Horsfield‚ which had been collected
in J ava, which led' me to give 111 the specific name of
Horsfieldii ‚· in 1822 it was found near Singapore *by
Wallich, and was named by him Acrostichum riyidum.1t
was, however, first described by Blume, under 11116 name of
Lomaria speciosa. It was also found by Cuming 111 the
Philippine Islands‚ who described it to me as growing on
111666, and being conspicuous by its shining fronds. In
vernation it agrees with Gymnopteris‚ buia its peculiar habit
and articulate pinnae does 11611 admit of its being associabed
with thais genus ; 111 these characters if, agrees with Drynaria
aud Dryoetachum, bui: its adherent vernation preveni-‚s its
alliance with these genera.
