INDUSIUM.

The sori are either naked or furnished with a special
covering called the indusium, or involucrum by some, which
presents many well marked different forms, and is highly
important for distinguishing genera ς, it consiste of three
kinds— special, accessory, and universal. Tme or special
indusia are more or less membranous‚ or thick and firm
in texture, and rise from the receptacles to which they are
attached in different ways. Some rise in the form of an
orbico-lar disc, covering the sorus in the form of a shield
. (peltata) 3 more frequently they are attached on the interior
or exterior side of the receptacle ; such are termed lateral,
which open like a lid (operwlzffom) when attached on the
side next the costa, interior, and when on the side next or
on the margin exterior.

Lateral indusia partake of the form of the sori, being
round, oblong, or linear3 in punctiform sori they are
attached by a point, or more or less by the base or sides,
and are of various forms, being reniform‚ subrotund‚ oval,

‚ or oblong, sometimes very small (sqmmfform). Their
surface is flat, vaulted, or when attached by their sides

cumulate, their free margin being entire or variously
lacinated or fringed.

Besides these two modes of attachment there is a third
kind, in which the indusium is attached all round the recep-
tacle—it is at first globose, and includes the sporangia,
but ultimately their apex opens and widens, thus assuming
the form of a cup (calyciform), the margin being more or less
entire or deeply laciniated, even to be like a fringe ; some-
times the attachment is only half round the receptacle

(semicalyciform).
