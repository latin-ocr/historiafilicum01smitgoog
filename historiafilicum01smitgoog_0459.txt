the sea. Many Hymnophyzleoe grow within the spray of
oaseades or on dripping rocks, and on mossy trunks of
trees. Geratopteris thalictroides grows in shallow water&
its sterile frouds floating on the water, and may be said to
be the only truly aquatio Fern, and one of the very few
annuals3 like many other aquatio plants it has a wide
geographioal range within or near the ‘tropios of both
hemispheres.

Many have· a great predileotion for the works of man,
whether elevated in the air or sunk below the earth, such
as old oastles‚ walls, embankmentg hedge and rond-side
banks, quarfies, or deep open pits or wells, this being
oommon to species of both tropioal and temperate oountries,
it is, therefore, not surprising to find the same species
assume different sizes and forms, as, for instance, the
common Hart's-tongue Fern‚ Scolopendrium vulyare‚ which
on walls and other dry plaoes produces fronds only a few
inehes in length, while in shedy places or open pits or
wells they may be found lining the sides with fronds two
to three feet in length.

Another example of a Fern making itself at home under
very opposite conditions is Pteria lonyzffolia, which is oom-
mon in or near the tropios of both hemispheres. On the
island of Isohia (in the Bay of Naples) it is found luxuriating
within the influenoe of the hot vapours rising from the
fissures of latent volcanio heat, growing in soft mud at a
temperature ranging from 140⁰ to 160⁰. In hothouses its
spores vegetato abundantly upon all moist surfaoes, and in
oeevioes olose to hot water tanks. It also establishes itself
in dry places, even in situations where the temperature is
often at or near freezing point.

Although Ferns thus eonform themselves to different
elimatos, many being wanderers, yet on taking a view of
