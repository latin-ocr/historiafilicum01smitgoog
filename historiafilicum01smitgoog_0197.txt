OBs-I agree wiiah Fee in thinking that this magnificent
Fern is worthy ofbeing considered as a (1161111101, genus; its
decumbenia vernation distinguishes 11, from true Gymno-
9ramma. It presenias three distinct forme, which have
been named as species, but they are united in the “ Species
Filicum.’' According to Hooker they are found 111 the
Malayan ArchipelagO, India, Oeylon, and West Tropioal
Africa, and Sandwich Islands.
