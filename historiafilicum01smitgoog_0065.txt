1 have now to notice an important but yet incomplete
work, the “ Index Filicum,” a synopsis with characters of
the genera, and an enumeration of the species of Ferns
with synonyms‚ and references, dvc„ Δια, by Mr. Thomas
Moore, Cui-ator of the Garden of Apothecaries, Ghelsea3
the first part of this work appeared in 185 7. The author
first gives a synopsis of the orders and tribes, followed by
a systematic arrangement and characters of the genera,
each genus illustrated by a woodcut showing the character
of the venation and position of the sori, also an analytical
table of the genera and their synonyms.

With regard to the number of genera the author tells ns
that he has endeavoured “ to hold a middle course between
the excessive sub-division and the equally inconvenient
non-division of older genera,'' and that the classification
adopted is based on the plan on which the vascular struc-
ture is developed, in conjunction with the nature of the
fructification. He enumerates 186 generff, which he
classifies under five orders, namely, Polypodiaoeae, Marani-
aceae, Ophioqlossaceae, Isyoopodiaoeae, and Mareileaceae.

The following abstract will be sufficient to convey an
idea of Mr. Moore's method of classifi cation.

FILIOALES, SPORROASES.
ORE-omnmo.
²¹¹ Spore-cases furnished with a jointed ring, which is
usually nearly complete, sometimes rudimentary.

ORDER 1.-POLYPOD1AOEAE.
