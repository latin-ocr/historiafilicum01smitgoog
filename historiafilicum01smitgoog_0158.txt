OBS.-At page 68 of the Introduction I have shown that
the vernation of Elaphoqlossum is apparently intermediate
between Eremobrya and Desmobrya, but more in favour of
the latter.

In the “ Synopsis Filicum'' sixty-five species are described,
and nearly as many more names recorded as doubtful;
and in the Appendix thirty-four new species are described.
M. Fee enumerates 116 species, of which sixty are repre-
sented by figures, On considering the very uniform
character of the fronde, as regards circumscription and
size, and that the principal differences consist in their
being smooth or more or less villose or squamose‚ to
which may be added slight variations in the venation‚
it becomes difficult to regard them as affording distinct
characters for even the smaller estimato of species. As
the evidence upon which the species are founded is
entirely derived from herbarium specimens‚ the number
consequently depende upon the views of authors.

The species are widely spread, being found very gene-
rally throughout the tropics, and extending to the latitudo
of 'Pristan d’Acunha in the southern hemisphere, and to
Madeira in the northern, abounding in the West Indies
and Tropical America‚ and in the Islands of the Indian and
Malayan Archipelago in the east.

²¹² Fronde smooth, or nearly so.

† Vernation sarmentose. Fronde distant.
