OBS.—The species of this genus present two very dis-
tinct aspects, which form two groups. In the first the
lacinus are plain, and often 1 inch or more in length, con-
stituting the genus Hortensia of Willdenow 3 in the second
the lacinoe are very small and revolute3 these are by some
termed true Gleichenia, but as the habit of growth of the

two groups is the same, and there is not sufficient difference
in the character of the sori to warrant their separation as
genera, 1 therefore arrange the species as follows :—

Gnmcnmm vera. (Oalymezla, Pon).
Lobes of the pinnae mall, wb- rotund, qenerally revolute.
Spcrcmqia terma‘nal.

Sp. G. microphylla, R. Br. (v v.;) G. dicarpa, R. Br.
