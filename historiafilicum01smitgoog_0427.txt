Ona—This genus, as originally characterised by Swarlzz,
contains species differing, in some having their fertile
fronds wholly contracted, forming a panicle, and in others
the fertile frond is tripartite, one branch being always

sterile, the other two 'always fertile. In my ‘⁸ Genera of Α

Ferns,” published in the “ Journal of Botany”. for 1841, Ι
restricted true Anemia to the species possessing the latter
character, a few of which, having anastomose venation, Ι
separated as a distinct genus (Anemidiotyon), those with
the sterile and fertile fronds wholly distinct Ι added to the
genus Molaria of Swartz. Subsequent observation has,
however, induced me to alter this view, and to consider
them more nearly related 10 Anemia than to Mohria.

Presl enumerates no less than forty species of Anemia,
which in the “ Synopsis Fih‘cum '⁹ are reduced to twenty-
six, A number are, however, termed varieties, the
numerous vintermediate forms of herbarium specimens
naturally lead to such a conclusion. With the exception
of A. Wiqhtiana, a native of the Neilgherries‚ A. Sohim-
pariana, a native of Abyssinia, and A. Dreqeana, a native of
South Africa, the whole are nativos of the West Indies and
Tropical and Sub-tropical Amerioa.
