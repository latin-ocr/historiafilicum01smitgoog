line. This is also the case with Leptoohilus‚ and on the
same grounds that Hymenolepis differs from Phymatodes,
does Leptochilus differ from Oolysis, with which it agrees in
habit.

Surculum short, caespitose. Fronds contiguous, furcately-
pinnatifid‚ 6 to 12 inches long, coriaceous, sparsely squami-
ferous, segments lanceolate-cuspidate, the fertile slightly
contracted. Veins obscure, simple or forked, free, or their
apices arcuately anastomosing, forming* linear transverse
superficial receptacles, which by contiguity constitute a con-
tinuous or interrupted‚ linear, intramarginal, naked sorus.

OBS.—In 1851 Fee separated the species of this genus
from Toenitia, and constituted of them the genus Cuspidaria ;
but as that name had been previously occupied by both
Link and De Candolle for two plants of different orders,
1 therefore in the ‘⁴ Botany of the Voyage of the Herald ''
substituted the above name. Fee enumerates three species,
two of which I adopt ; the third having fasciculate adherent
vernation comes under the genus Pteropsis. In habit and
texture of the fronde, the species of this genus, seem to
mark their relationship to be with Pleopeltideoe‚ but differ
in the venules anastomosing, forming arches near the
margin, on which the sporangia are produced.
