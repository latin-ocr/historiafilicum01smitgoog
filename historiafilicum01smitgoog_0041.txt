Hmnionitis, Polypodium, Asplenium, Pteria, Bleohnum, Lon-
ekites, and Trickomanes. The data upon which they were
founded were derived, as in flowering plante, from the
different modificatione and position observed in their so-
called organs of fructification. The chief difference con-
sisted in the fructification——spore cases or sporanqia-being
produced either in defined round masses, or in 111168, or
densely crowded together on the under side of the frond,
or in, simple spikes or panicles formed by the whole or a
portion only of the fertile frond being contracted. Thus,
according to Linnaeus’ charactere, all Ferus having their
fructification in simple or racemose spikes belong to
Omunda and Onoolea,· in crowded masses to Aorostichwm5
in round 11168868 01· spots to Polypodium; in lines across
one another to Hemioniti83 in lines diverging from the
mid-rib to Asplenium ,· in a line on each side of the mid-rib
to Bleohnwm5 in a line or dots on the margin to Pieris and
Adiantum,· in a sinus on the margin to Lonchit633 and
inserted on the margin to Trichoma‘nee.

These Linnean genera are each composed of a greater
or lesser number of species, each of which is presumed to
agree in the form and position of the fructification with the
respective· generic characters 68 above stated. But the
more careful examination by later observers of the same
generic forms has revealed additional variatione, which
will come under notice as we proceed. It is worthy of
remark, however, that the whole of the species of Ferns
now known are capable of being referred to Linnean
genera; but if such were done, species possessing very
different appearances as regards habit and mode of growth
would be brought together, and the genera would be of
unwieldly dimensions.
