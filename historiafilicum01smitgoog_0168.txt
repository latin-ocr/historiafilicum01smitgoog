aud in the fertile segmenta being involutae.

Acro-stichum sp. auct„ Hook. Sp. Fit.

Vemation uniseriaL sarmenizum short or elongaoed.
Fronde contiguous or distanlz, pinnato, 1 to 3 feet long,
bulbiferouS. Primary veins costaeform, pinnato, venules
arcuately or angularly anastomoeing‚ producing on their
exterior eides or angles one or more free or anastomosing
veinlets‚ forming unequal areolos, Fertile pinnae some-
times scarcely contracted‚ the venules then distinctly
sporangiferous.

OBS.—The various and very different stabes exhibited by
this genus has led not only to the forming of many speciee,
but also bo genera having been founded on different etates
of the same specieS, chiefly on the variatione of the fertile
frond being more or less contracbed.

In some fronde of the same species the contractiori of
the ferlzile pinnae is often very little, the venation is then
more or 1888 evidenlz, and are then distinotly sporangiferous‚
forming linear anastomosing sori3 labis state constitui-aes
the genus Jenkinsia of Hooker‚ figured and described in
Hook. and Bauer’s Gen. Fil„ t. 75, B, which in some cases
scarcely differs from Meniscium or Steqnoqramma, and with
which Poecilopteris agrees in habita, differing only in the
veins of bhe sterile fronde being more compound anastomosed
