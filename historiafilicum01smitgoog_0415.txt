as a distinct natural order of Ferus, which I do not dcem
it desirable to adopt. I must, however, admit that it has
no direct affinity with any other family of Ferns, except
with the tribe Saccolomoae‚ through the genera Looeeoma
and Miorolepia.

The peculiarity of the sporangia consists in being ses.
silely attached by its inner side to the columnar receptaole,
the point of attachment being central, or more generally
eccentric towards the lower limb, and the numerous spo-
rangia being compactly seated round the receptacle, they
consequently acquire a flattened ferm, each having an arti-
eulated ring passing round it, at a more or less oblique or
at a right angle with the point of attachment, being thus
analogous to the flattened sporangia of many Gyatheoe, as
noticed at page 41.

Most authors place the whole of the species under the
genera Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes. On comparing
the respective characters of these two genera it will be
observed that their technical distinctions are not very

' definite, depending chiefly upon the differenee in length

and more or less bilabiate character of the indusium, in
conjunction with the varying length of the sporangiferous
receptacle. In those species which may respectively be
considered as typical‚ these characters are sufficiently mani-,
fest, and leave no· doubt as to the genus to which they
should be referred ς but the numerous intermediate forms,
and the different appearanees presented by some species at
different periods of growth‚ osten render the determination
of the genus by herbarium specimens very embarassing‚
and the difficulty is still further increased by the fact that
the two genera contain individua] species agreeing perfeotly
in general habit. It therefore appears to me that the
distinction between Hymenophyllasm and fflohomanes is
