fascicle terminate before reaching, or at the margin, their
apices being free and unconnected ; and anastomom'nq when
the apices of the branches of each proximate fascicle unite
with one another, which they do in various ways, forming
regular, square, rhomboid, hexagonal, or unequal sided
meshes (areolas). When the primary 161116 616 1161 evident,
and all the anastomoses of about equal size, it is termed
reticulate venat-ion. ,

Both free and anastomosing 161116 616 spoken of as
follows ·:—-Simple, when each vein proceeds from the costoe
to the margin without branching. Forked, when they
divide at an acute angle into two or more branchos, aster
leaving the costae. Pinnately forked, when the primary
veins are scarcely defined, the venules dichotomously
branching. Pinnate, when the primary 161116 11161 run
from the costae to the margin are distinctly defined, and
produce venules in regularorder on both sides, forming a
more or less acute or oblique angle with their axis.

The simplest form of anastomosing venation is when the
apices of simple or forked veins are combined or connected
by means of a vein close to and continuous with the mar-
gin, as in the genera Olfereia and Neottopterie. Pinnate and
pinmtely-sorked veins anastomose by the uniting of the
apices of the 161111166 of the proximate fascicles, which they
do at various angles, from acute to nearly a right angle, or
even arcuate as in Menisoium, or straight as in Blochnum.

In most of these cases, the connected venules produce from
the apex of their angular junction, or from their exterior
sides, one or more outward directed veinlets (6666116111),
which are either free or unite with the next exterior anas-
tomose, thus forming in the latter case 1116 61 111616 16116
of areoles between the primary veins. When anastomose
venales form a right or nearly a right angle with the
