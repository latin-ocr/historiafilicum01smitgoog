ΙΝ submitting this volume to the notice of those in·
terested' in the study of Ferne 1 consider it proper,
though at the risk of being considered egotistical, to
give a. brief explanation of the circumstances that have
led to its publication.

My first introduction to Fernn wan in acquiring the
names of the common British *speciem In 1823 the
collection in the Royal Botanic Garden‚ Kew, came
under my care5 it then consisted of about forty hardy
speciest, British and Foreign, and about the same
number of tender exotica, the latter dispersed in various
hothouses. In 1825 I arranged the tender ones in a.
group at the end of one of the then lean-to houseS,
the space they occupied being 12 feet by 6 feet;
these formed the nucleus of the present great collec-
tion. ’

New species were occasionally imported, and othere
raised from speres, the spores being obtained from
collectione of dried specimen8‚ chiefly from the West

Indiee, Brazil, and Australia, aleo from a collection of
