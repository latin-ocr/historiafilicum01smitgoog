Ona—This genus represents 11116 simplest state of vena·
tion in Ferus, 11116 fronds being so small and narrow that
no la’oeral veins are produced, the whole vascular structure
consisting of 11116 mid-rib only. In the typical species of
the genus, Μ. qraminea, the sporangia are produced 011 the
face of the mid-rib 3 but in an additional species of recent
discovery, the sporangia are seated in grooves 011 each side
of the mid-rib, and alchough this is a very special cha-
racter, it nevertheless does not seem to me sufficient to
warram: their separassion as a disfinciz genus.

OBS.—These species are widely distribufed, being found
in South Africa, Mauritius, Borneo, Philippines, New
Hebrides‚ also in the Wesh Indies and Central America.

In M. trichoidea 11116 line of the sporangia is interi-upted,
forming several short sori, each included in a fold of the
frond, similar bo a sheath, which M. Fee has considered
worthy of being characterised as a distinct genus which
he has named V aqinularea, but which Ι do 1101, adopt.
