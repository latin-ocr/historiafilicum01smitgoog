They vary considerably in size, many not being lai-ger
than mosses and liverworts and of as delicate a texture ; a
very few partake of the character of shrubs, and about one
hundred and fifty assume the aspect of trees, some attain-
ing the height of fifty or more feet.

As the special character of their structure is fully ex-
plained further on, the above is sufficient to give an idea of
the nature of FernS.
⁹ Although Ferns possess but few economic properties,
either as food, medicine, or in the arts, they have never-
theless become of great interest to botanists, their study
being termed Pteridoloqy, on which many books have been
written, 'and during the last fifty years have also come into
special favour with amateur plant cultivators‚ and lovers of
pretty plants. The constant desire for novelty has led
both public and private plant collectors and persons livin g
in foreign countries to devote special attention to the col-
lecting of Ferns, both for herbarium specimens and also as
living plants. By these means the collections of Europe
have become greatly enriched. It is recorded that the
Royal Herbarium at Kew contains 50‚000 specimens of
Ferus, which have been communicated by no less than
about 150 public, private, and trade collectors from all
regions: the Fern collection in the herbarium of the
British Museum is also very extensive. These, with the
living collection at Kew, which in 1864 contained above
one thousand species, have afforded ample means for study
and determining the genera and species of Ferns. Many
extensive living collections are also formed by amateurs‚
who in rivalry enhance their value to such an extent that
as much as fifty guineas is frequently given for a single
plant -of fashionable reputa at the time.

Of late years many books have been published on Ferus,
