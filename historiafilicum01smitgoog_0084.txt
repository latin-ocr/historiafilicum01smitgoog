This is particularly the case in the extensive tribes
Polypodieoe, Acrosticheae, Pheyopterideae, and Aspidieoe, each
of which contains groups of species possessing similar
venation‚ and agreeing so perfectly in habit and mode of
growth‚ that, in the absence of the fructification, it is often
difficult to determine· to which genus and tribe they should
be referred. For instance, leyopteris and Lastrea, Poly·
botrya and Polystichum, Goniopteris and Nephrodium, Dryo-
mencs and Aspidium‚ respectively agree both in habit and
venation‚ apd all, with the exception of Polybotrya, have
punctiform sori, and, as already stated, these and kindred
genera can only be known from one another by the
presence or normal absence of the indusium, or by the
fertile fronds being contracted, as in Polybotrya. There-
fore‚ taking all these points into consideration, it appears
to me that, in order to arrive at the true affinity of Ferus,
the vascular structure, in conjunction with mode of growthr
must be viewed as forming the groundwork of any at-
tempted natural classification. It must, however, be under-
stood that differences in venation do not always indicate
distinct modes of growth or habit ; for example, Pheyopteris
and GoniopteriS, Polybotrya and Saromanes, Pieris and Lito.
brochia, Adiantum and Hewardia‚ Lastrea and Nephrodium,
⁷³⁴ 'ea ,and Synaphlebium, respectively contain species

bly analogous in habit and other characters, and only
cally distinguished by the venation being free, or
mose. Another circumstance to be considered is
er free or anastomose venation is always constant in
:ne species. In any uncertainty upon this point it is
ary to be first assui-ed that the specimens under
iation have arrived at sufficient age to have the
l structure of the species -fully developed, for in
of young plants the venation is osten free while in
