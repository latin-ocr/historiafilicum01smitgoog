OBS.—The grass-like fronds of this Fern not exceeding
a line in width, renders it difficult to determine bhe exact
naizure of its venation. Oareful examination induces me
to draw up the above character, which agrees wilsh that
given by Brackenridge ; but in the “ Species Filicum '' the
line of sporangia are described as only occupying one side
of fihe costa.

OBse—'I'his as a genus differs from Monoqramma by the
presence of laboral veins, eud in the sporangia being pro·
duced in a line on each side of, and close tc, the mid-rib,

also in having fasciculate vernation.
