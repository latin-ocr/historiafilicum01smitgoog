specimens of the same species are found, some with the
indusia and some without, for instance, being present at
the distribution of Cuming’s Philippine Island collection
of specimens in 1841, Ι noted that number 315 was
indusiato, which in my enumeration of that collection
I named N ephrodium simlicifolium. It was not till nearly
twenty years afterwards when Cuming’s specimens of this
species came under Sir William Hooker’s observation for
entry in the “ Species Filicum,'’ that finding it had no
indusium he placed it under Polypodiwm in the section
Goniopteris.

Another example of the untrustworthiness of the indu-
sium as a generic character is verified in Pheyoptmds
ficem, described by me in the “Botany of the Voyage
qs the Heraldss’ from specimens collected by Seemann in
Darien3 Mettenius also retains it in Pheqopteris‚ but makes
it a synonym of Aspida‘um brachyodon of Kunze, while in
the “ Species Filicum'’ it is placed in Nephrodiwm, the
“ involucre ’' being described as “ small fugaceous,’' thus
showing that at least some of the specimens in the Kew
herbarium were indusiate3 but as several American locali-
ties, as also the Malayan Peninsular and islands, are given
as stations for this Fern‚ it is therefore quite possible that
the American and Malayan specimens represent two dis-
tinct species, one with indusiate sori, and the other with
naked. This and several other allied species is peculiar
in having stout 'arboroid stems a foot or more in height,
with the pinnae articulate with the rachis, as also in the
lobes of the pinnae being joined by a line like a seam,
which extends from the mid-rib of the pinnae to the sinus
between each two lobes, by which in 'time the lobes become
separated as if artificially cut. Setting aside the presence or
absence of the indusium, and in the venules being free
