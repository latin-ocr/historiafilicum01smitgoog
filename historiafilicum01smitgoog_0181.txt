Ona—A. obliquum of Blume is founded on simple fronde,
which may be considered as an abnormal state.

Trite 7.—ME:NISOEAE. (Plato 7.)

Fronde pinnato, rarely simple. Vcins anastomosing,
> evident. Scri linear, arcuate transverse or reticulated,
osten confluent.

Ona—This tribe consists of about a dozen species, the
principal number being comprehended under the genus
Meniscium.

Hitherto Ι have associated Meniscium with Dictyopteris
and Goniopteri8‚ and there is no doubt that it forms a
natural connection between Poecilopteris and these genera3
but on viewing what Ι have stated under Poeoilopteris, Ι
now consider it to have more ‘relationship with that genus
than with its former allieS, Ι therefore rank it as a transition
tribe between Aarosticheae and Pheqopterideoe, of which
Meniscium simplex is an example, and, as already stated
at page 62, cultivated plante become truly acrostichoid,
but as the venation of the sterile frond is more in character
with that of Meni-scium than with Poecilopleris, Ι therefore
retain it under the former.

62.—Mnn1sc1tm‚ Schreb. (1791).

¹ Vernation decumbent, subfasciculate. Fronde contiguouS‚
pinnato, rarely simple, 1 to 8 feet high. Primary veins
costaeform, pinnate‚ each opposite pair of venules angularly
or arcuately anastomosing, and sporangiferouS, producing
from their junction an. excurrent, free, sterile veinlet.
Receptacles linear, continued across the junction of the
venuleS‚ forming arcuate transverse sori. Sporanqia in
some species pilose.
