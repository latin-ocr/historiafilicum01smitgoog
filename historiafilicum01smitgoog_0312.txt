bipinnabe, 2 to 3 feet long3 pinnae distant, 1 foot long,
pinnules linear lanceolate, acuminato, dentato, sub-auricu-
lated‚ truncate at the base, articulate with izhe rachis. Veins
simple or forked, parallel, their apices free, terminating in
the marginal dents, and sporangiferous3 accessory indusium

special indusium, the {awo together forming an unequal’,
bivalved oyen, forming a row of marginal denteform sori.

OBS.—This genus is founded on a very rare Fern, first
described by Sir J. Ε. Smith in Ree’s Cyclopaedia, from

*specimens collected in the Island of Honimoe‚ Moluccas, by
Christopher Smilzh, between seventy and eighty years ag0.
It appears not to have been since collected, as only three or

· „fom- specimens are to be found in herbaria in this country,

and these consist of portione of fronds only, and nothing is
known as to whether it has acaulose or arboroid vernation.
'Phe marginal bivalved indusia agrees with some Dicksonia
such as Oibotium, but its simple lanceolate pinnae being·
articulate wiizh the rachis, seems to indicate its relationship
izo be with the section Arthroptereae of Aspideae rather than
with any genus of Dicksonia, but till more is known of it,

1 place here.
