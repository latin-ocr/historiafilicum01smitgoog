subsequent authors ; and in consequence of many species
of Linnaeus‚ Swartz‚ and other early authors, being but
indifferently described, many being founded on imperfect

specimenS, and nothing but the meagre description left us
for their identification. It frequently happens that some

modern author detects or supposes that he has found out
that the new species of his contemporary is one of the
Linnean or Swartzian doubtful specieS, and on his decision
being confirmed, names long familiar have to be changed.
Again‚ by the distribution of trade and private herbarium
collections, sets of the same specimens fall in the hands of
different botanists at the same time, and each being eager
to describe what he considers new, and not, in some in-
stances, having studied the special families, nevertheless
does not hesitate to describe new species, or to found new
genera. This being done without inter-communication,
different names are given to the same plants ; when these
are collated by 1110 systematist‚ it often becomes difficult to
decide which to adopt, thus burdening the science with
synonyms. .
Under this state of things few Ferns have now less than
three names, many have twenty, thus rendering it in many
cases impossible to reconcile one author’s views with an-
other’s. For instance, the Fern known by the name of
Ceratopteris thalictroides has been described by no less than
twelve authors under as many different generic and specific
names, ⁴ .
But the point upon which pteridologists appear to
differ most, and upon which their only agreement seems to
be an agreement to differ, is the definition of genera and
their limits. I say emphatically appear to differ, for in the
works of those most at issue the differences are not so
much in the limits of the groups themselves as in the
