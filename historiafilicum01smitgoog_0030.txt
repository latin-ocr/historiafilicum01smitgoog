FRON DS.

Tun fronde before expansion are involutely coiled, in 1110
manner of a watch spring, and gradually 1100011 during
the period of growth, and with a few exceptions have all
their parts formed before they begin to unfold (definite),
all of which increase in size with the progress of the frond.
Fronds present extreme variation in size and form, vary-
ing from less than an inch to 15 or 20 feet in length, and
in form, from entire, like a blado of grass or ribbon to
being compoundly divided. In describing them, the same
terms are used as are applied to the leaves of flowering
plants, that is, they are simple, entire, linear lanceolata
ovate, elliptioal or sub-rotund, or they are pedate or pal-
mately lobed, pinnatzfid, 01· they are pinnato, *bi-tripinnate, or
more highly divided, and then termed compound multifid-
They also vary considerably in texture, some being thin,
pollucid‚ membranous, and flaccid3 while others are thick,
fleshy‚ or hard and rigid.

In pinnate, bi-and-tripinnate fronds, the divisions (seq-
ments) of the first are called pinnae and the second pin-
nules, each of which individually represents 8 simple
frond. The margins of simple fronds, and of 1110οω 8011
pinnules, are either entire or variously dentate or sinuoso
repand, regularly pinnatifid 01· otherwise div-idad, the divi.
81008 being called lobes or lacinoe. The general form of
fronds, whether simple or in any way divided, is linear
1800001810, 01· oblong elliptical, or deltoid ; in deltoid com-
pound fronds, the primary pinnae assume the character of
,branches, 1110 ultimate divisione of which are often divided
1010 small lacinae or dents‚ such being tei-med multifid.
The axis of attachment of the pinnae and pinnules is
