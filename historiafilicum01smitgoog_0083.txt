11116 an imporfianb part in defining genera; but in many
cases if 1116 characters derived from 1116 form are strictly
adher-ed 10, species possessing very differem-1 appearances
are brought hogether. For instance, 1116 small grass-like
Ferns of 1116 genus Grammitis of Swartz are characterised
by having linear naked sori; 11111 by adbel-ing 10 this
simple character alone, species of very different habit .'
would be included, as Gymnoqrmnmffi Steqnoqramm a, Loaeo-
mamma, Pleuroqramma, Sellcqua, and others, which, as
already sbated, has 10 a considerable 61116111 106611 so done in
1116 “ Species Filicum.'' The sori are also liable 10 vary in
form and size in differenfi specimens of 1116 same species, or
even on 1116 same, or differenlz ffronds of 1116 same plant.
This usually happens by 1116 contiguous puncbiform recep-
tacles uniting laterally, when they assume on oval, oblong,
or linear form. Examples of this may be found in 1116
genera Pleopeztis, Phymatodoe, Plewridium, Drymria, Aspi-
dium, and 0111618. Α. remarkable instance of this occurs in
the splendid Fern Drynaria coronans (Polypodium coronans,
Wall.), a species with large pinnabifid fronds, which in 1116
presumed normal 61616 as generally observed‚ has 1116 sori
distinctly punctiform, and produced in a single row between
each pair of 1116 primary veins. In some fremis, however,
1116 sori are so completely united in a line as 10 fonm a 11116
linear 301116, and hence 1101 only agree perfectly with 1116
character of Grammitis, as defined by Swarbz, but also with
the genus Gymnoyramma‚ as characterised in 1116 “ Species
Filicum.''⁹ These examples show that 1116 form of 1116 sori
alone canno& be shwfly depended upon for defining genera.

In previous remarks I have stated 111111 1116 mode in
which 1116 vascular 6111101016 traverses 1116 fronds (vena-

11011) affords imperi-,aniz data in assisssing 10 define 1116 limits
cf genera.
