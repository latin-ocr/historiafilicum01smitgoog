Ona—This genus is found on a solitary species, a native
of J uan Fernandez ; it is said to have a slender arborescent
stem, which seems to be correct, as shown by imported
plants cultivated at Kew.

In the “ Species F ilicum ” Thyrsopteris is placed in the
tribe Gyathea, but its termina] marginal sori, and general
habit, clearly indicates its relationship tq be with Dicksewia.
It agrees with the following genuS, Balantium, in having
decompound fronde, differing only in the fertile segments
being contracted into pedicels, each bearing a globose

sorus, forming panicles‚ hence the name Particularia given
to the genus by Colla in 1836.
