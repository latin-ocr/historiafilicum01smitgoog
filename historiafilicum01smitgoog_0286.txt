Ona—This genus contains low growing Ferus, with the
general character of the small species of the Lophidium
section of Lastrea, but it is technically distinguished by the
indusium being short, ovate, or oblong, and vaulted, so as
to form a cucullate marsupial cyst, opening exteriorly.
It has also some claime of relationship with Athyrimn3 but
the base ef attachment of the indusium being across the
venule—-not longitudinally along one side as in that genus ’
——indicates its natural affinity to be with Lastrea.

Representatives of this genus are found widely spread
over the northern part of Europe, Asia, and America, even
to within the Arctic circle, and also in several localities in
the southern hemisphere. The different appearances of
specimens and observation of living plants from different
localities, have giren rise to at least twenty species being
described by various authors; but careful examination
reduces that number to the following.

With the exception of Ο. montana, all the species have
