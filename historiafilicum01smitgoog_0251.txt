Ona—In many points of sia-ucham this genus agrees
with (lyr-tomum, the chief difference being the hypogeous
sub-sarmentose vernation‚ the more simply anasbomosed
- venation‚ and the specially eontracted fertile fronds. The
latter character also is the chief disffinction between this
genus and some species of Nephrodium, in which the
fertile fronds have a tendency ‘to contraction. I restricta
Cycladium ‘to {zhree described species, nativos of Eastern
Tropical America. In the “ Species Filicum ’⁹ Hooker unitos
Aspidium consertum of Kaulfuss with A. mnisoioides, Will-
denow, bub judging from cultivated specimens of A.
consertum of British Gaiana, as compared with herbarium
specimens of A. meniscioides from Trinidad, they appear to
me ‘to represent distinct species.
