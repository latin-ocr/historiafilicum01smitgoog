Receptacles more or less elevated. Indusium calyciform‚
semi-calyciform or lateral (scale like), or absent or repre-
sented by numerous articulate hairs.

OBS.—-The plants constituting this tribe (together with
those ‘of the genus Dicksonia as here restricted) are truly
the giants of the Fern race‚ their erect arboreous stems
often attaining the height of 50 or more feet, and having a
crown of decompound (rarely simple or simply pinnate)
frondS, sometimes 20 feet in length, the bases of their stipes
being either articulated with the stem and, when mature,
separating at the articulation‚ the point of attachment
being afterwards indicated by scars of an oblong rhomboid
form, spirally arranged round the stem3 or more or less
of the lower part of the stipes remain permanent and
become indurated‚ forming part of the solid structure of
the stem, which is often much increased in thickness by
the production of numerous outgrowing aerial, wiry, black
roots, forming a coating from a few inches to a foot in
thickness.

The species are widely distributed, chiefly within or near
the tropice, the number being nearly equal in the old and
new worlds. They love shade and solitude, and in humid
regions within the tropics are found at elevatione of from
3‚000 to 6‚000 feet, often in ravines. In Sikkim‚ Hima-
laya‚ the tribe is represented by eight or nine specieS, all
of which are to be found within three miles of Rungbee.
The stems often branch into many crownS. About a dozen
are distributed throughout the islands of the Pacific ocean,
their southernmost limit being Tasmam’a, N ew Zealand,
and Norfolk Island, where they grow at a lower elevation
than within the tropics. Also several new species have
recently been discovered in the Bellenden Ker range of
mountains, Queensland.
