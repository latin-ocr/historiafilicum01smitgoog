OBS.-· This genus as here restricoed, includes a consider-
ablenumber of species varying greatly in size and circum-
scription of the fronds, but all agreeing in having the
sporangia produced on forked free veinS, forming linear,
naked sori, examples of the extreme sizes being represented
on the one hand by Ο. leptophylla‚ an annual a few inches
high, and the magnificent species, G. javanica and G. pro-
cera (Gonioqramma, Fe5e), which have fronds 2 to 5 feet
high, with broad pinnae.

These differences have induced some* authors to cha-
racterise the different groups as distinct genera, of which
Professor Link has five, and with some alterations M. Fee
makes ten, the whole including about forty specieS. Sir
William Hooker‚ in his “ Species Filicum‚'’ goes much
beyond this3 he includes all Ferns with oblong, linear,
oblique, naked sori, thus including species with both free
and anastomosing venation, under which he describes
seventy-five species, thus making it a more unnatural
genus than when it was in its original state 3 he, however,
divides them into six sections, the last including the genus
Selliquea of Bory, which belongs to the division Eremobrya,
and therefore has no natural relationship with Gymno-
9ramma. With regard to true Gymnoyramma, I consider it
best to adopt, so far as Ι find convenient, Link and Fee's
generic names as sectional names only.
