ons—This genus consiste of a solitary species, a native
of New Zealand, which in habit is similar to some species
of Davallia as originally characterised, but more especially
to the species placed under M icrolepia3 but differs in its
sporangia being imbricate, round a columnar receptacle‚
similar to the genus Trichomavaes. This, with the ob-
liquity of the ring, renders Looesoma of some importance
as a· connecting link between the present tribe and
Trichomane&
