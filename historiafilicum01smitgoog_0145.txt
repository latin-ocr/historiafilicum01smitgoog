appearance and venation it is evidently allied to Ampelti⁸3
but its linear oblique sori being special not formed by the
confluence of punctiform receptacles is considered sufficient
character to retain it as a distinct genus.

Fronde simple or pinnatifidly lobed, the fertile wholly or
partially contracted. Veins anastomosiug. Sori linear,
continuous, transverse.

OBS.-—This 'Px-ibe consiste of about a dozen or more
species agreeing in general habit and venation with the
sections Pleopeltideae and Phymatodeoe of the preceding tribe,
differing only in the fertile frond being usually more or
less contracted, generally in the form of rachiform spikes‚
on which account several of the genera which 1 now place
here have been placed by authors in the genera Toenitis
and Act-ostiolum, such relationship being consequent on the
fertile frond, or in some, the ferffle portion only, being
contracted, thus bringing the normal punctiform recepta·
cles so contiguous to one another as to form a general
linear sorus; this view is borne out by fronds of some
species bearing punctiform sori as well as linear.
