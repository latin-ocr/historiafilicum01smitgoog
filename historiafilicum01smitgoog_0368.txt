302 emmeram or mnus Ano canu·

om.-of the twenty-two species here enumerated
eighteen have come under my notice⁴ in a living· wate,
several of which are recorded as synonyme in the “ Synep-
sis Filicum,” but my observatione on the liv-ing plante
satisfy me that the above are sufficiently distinct to be
viewed as species. The synonymy of many of the species
is, however, most difficult to mravel, for instance, B.
orientale has no less than thirty-eight, and Β. occidemlc
nearly twenty synonyma.

Bleohwam mlanopmts of the “ Species=Filicum” is described
aa. being a pinnate species, about a span in length, similar

· in appearance to a young frond of Β. orientale, but differing

from Blechnwm in having reticulate venatica, which Mr.
Moore has thought proper'to adopt as characteristic of a
distinct genus, which he names Blochmldium. The descrip-
tion of this Fern is taken from a solitary frond gathered in
Khasya, which probably may turn out to be a young· state
of a Woodwardia.

Vernation uniserial, sarmentose or fasciculate, erect, caes-
pitose or subarborescent. Fronde simple, pinnatifid, or pin-
nate, rarely bipinnatifid, 1 to 3 feet high, the fertile always
contr-acted. V eins (of the sterile frond) forked 3 venules
free, their apices usually clavate 3 fertile segmenta rachi-
form, veins obsolete, or more or less evident, and by their
contiguity forming a broad, transverse, continuous, speran-
giferous receptacle‚ the sporangia becoming confluent over
the whole disc of the segment. Indusium linear, subdntra.
marginal, vaulted, and involute, the margin oppositely
