Ona—This genus was first characterised by me in Dr.
Hooker’s ‘⁴ Flora of New Zealand,” the type being Pobypo-
dium tenellam Forster. Ι there stated that although no
indusium had been detected on New Zealand specimens I
nevertheless associated with it the Nephrodimn obliteratum
of Brown‚ which has a very small fugacious indusium, aud
although Aspich'um albo-punctatwm of Bory, has a well-
defined reniform indusium, its other points of character
seem to indicate its affinity with A. tenella. The apparent
articulation at or near the base of the stipes of A. tenella
and A. obliterata gives them some claim to rank in Ery.
mobrya, and in A. albo-punctam the apparent joint is often
2 to 3 inches above the base of the stipes. These charac-
ters seem to indicate a natural relatiouship of these species
to one another, to which I add Polypodium heteromorphwm,
a Fern of peculiar habit of growth, having slender dichoto-
mous or unequally branching frontis, each branch being
pinnate, the pinnae numerous, obloug, entire or variously
lobed‚ not exceeding half an inch in length, their bases
articulate with the rachis, and having white dots on the
upper surface, which, with the sori being terminal and
naked, leads me to consider these points sufficient to
warrant its being placed in the present genus. It is a
native of Mexico, New Grenada, and other parts of tropica]
America, growing round the base of trunks of trees, on
moist rocks, aud even in caves, its slender frouds being
pendulous, similar to some species of Otenopteris and Hy-
menophyllum.
