the sterile, once or many times dichotomously forked‚ 2 to
6 feet in length3 segments broad, obtuse, densely covered
with stellated scales, ooriaceous. Veins internal, compound
anastomosing. Reoeptaozes amorphous, occupying more or
less of the under side of the segments, or on a sessile or
petiolate lobe, forming dense masses of sporangia.

Osa—The whole habit and character of the species
forming this genus is very peculiar, and totally distinct
from any other genus of Ferns‚ but agreeing in the amor-
phous production of the sporangia with Aorosticlzum, but
although the axis of the vernation is scarcely defined,
it nevertheless exhibits the articulate node of Eremo-
brya. 1 therefore place it in this division. The thick
coriaceous texture, and the stellated pubescense, show
some analogy to Niphobolus. Besides its peculiar habit,
the sporangiferous receptacle also presents a structure
peculiar to this genus, being formed of an accessory layer
of minute veinlets, which appear independent of the vas-
cular structure.

Five species are described as belonging to this genus,
which until lately were considered to be entirely natives of
the tropics and extra tropics of the Eastern hemisphere,
extending from Western Tropical Africa through the
islands of the Indian Oeean, Malayan, Philippine‚ and other
islands in the Eastern Pacific, as also the eastern coast of
Australia, extending to about the latitude of Sydney. This
wide eastern range is not now special, Mr. Spruce having
recently discovered P. akicorne at Tarapota‚ in the Andean

regions of Brazil.
