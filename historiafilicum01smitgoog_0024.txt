stances of observation and discrimination‚ uncertainty often
prevails. , For instance, no class of plante has of late
years been more written about than the Ferns of Great
Britain; and yet much diversity of opinion still exists
amongst British botanists regarding the number of specieS,
although they have 'the opportunity of carefully and
leisurely examining them under. every circumstance con-
nected with the different aspects they assume in their
various places of growth. This surely offers some pallia-
tion for the errors committed by the general pteridologist,
more especially when we consider that the Ferns of Great
Britain are in number as one to sixty of the Fern-flora of
the earth.

Having had under my observation for nearly half a cen-
tury the Fern collection in the Royal Gardens at Kew,
which, as already stated, amounted in 1864 to about a
thousand species, and having during that period carefully
noted their different modes of growth and aspects, I have
been induced to consider that the differences seen in a series
of closely allied living Ferus, are much more obvious than
in examples of the same when seen in the herbarium. ÷It
is, however, often difficult to express their differences in
words, but the eye readily distinguishes them, and knowing
that each form maintains its own peculiar habit from year
to year, reproducing its like from spores (seeds), Ι am,
therefore, induced to consider that although closely allied,
they are nevetheless sufficiently different to be regarded as
distinct species.

Another point which renders it difficult to ,arrive at
any satisfactory conclusion as to the correct number of
specim, is the botanical rule which prescribes that the
specific name under which a plant is first described, is to
be retained in whatever genus it may be referred to by
