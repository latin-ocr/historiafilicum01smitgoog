Ona—The first is a native of South Brazil, and the other
very generally distributed throughout the West Indies and
Tropical Amerina. As might be expected, the plants of the
different localities have been described under no 1666 than
ten· specific names, their differences resting entirely on the
difference of length and breadth of the sterile pinnae, which,
although retained under, cultivation, Ι do not consider it a
’ sufficient character to be specific. -

wheels. It may be considered to be a modified state of
Anemia, but its distinct habit is sufficient to mark it as a

separate genus.
