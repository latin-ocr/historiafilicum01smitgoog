Ona—This genus was originally founded upon two Ferae,
natives of Brazil; alhhough nob differing much in general
habit or in technioal characters from Pezzaea, ib is never-
theless refiained by most authors as a genue; a third

by ilas discoverer‚ Dr. Gardner3 it is, however, so widely
different in habit and appearance, and in its beohnioal
characters, thas» Ι deem it advisable bo separare ἰὴ from
Cassebeera (see Omopteris).
