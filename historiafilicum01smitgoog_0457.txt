2. ΟΝ THE GEOGRAPHIGAI, DISTRIBUTION 01¹· FERRS.

As already stated, the number of species of Ferus
amounts to about 2,500‚ whioh are widely spread over
the earth, being found more or less numerous in all

elimatos between the most northern and southern limita ’

of vegetable life; and within the tropios from the sea
level to elevatione of from 14,ΟΟΟ to 15,000 feet, their
number in any looality being generally in proportion .
to the degree of atmospherio moisture in conjunction ⁸

with elevation. Few or none are found in dry or flat

oountries, such as grassy, sorubby, or thinly-wooded pla-ins,

or mountain slopes, extensive tracte of which are osten in

possession of one of the most cosmopolitan and abundant

of all Ferus, the oommon Brake (Pteris aquilina). In hot

and moist plains the number of speeies is comparatively

small; even in the extensive lower valley of the Amazon,

teeming as it does with vegetable life, the number of

Ferns found by Dr. Spruoe after he left the ooast Flora at

Para, in his journey of 2‚000 miles, was small, but they

gradually became more numerous on attaining an elevation

of 1,500 feet; and in one locality at a higher elevation he

found 250 speeies in an area of fifty miles in diameter.

Another traot with but few Ferns is the dry region of ἰ
N orthem Africa and Arabia, and few as yet have been

recorded from the intprior of Australia3 while on the

*conti-ary, on many elevated coasts and islands they form a

large portion of their Flora.

They are most numerous both as regards genera and
speeies in the tropioal and sub-tropieal regions3 and
although, as a general rule, the different zones or latitudes
oontain speeies peouliar to the different regions, yet many
