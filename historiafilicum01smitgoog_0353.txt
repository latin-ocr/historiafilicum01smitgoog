' guished by the venafion *being reticulam, in sshat respect
agreeing with the following genus, Litobroom‘a.

The following are the principal well-marked species, all
of which are nativos of the Western hemisphere, except D.
ludens, which is a. native of the Malayan and Philippines‚
and which also differs from the rest of the species in its
vernation being sarmentose.

²* Vernation uniserial, sarmentose.

D. ludens (nsaw.) (DJ walliam, J. Sm„ 1841; Beda.
F. Brit. Jnd. ,.pl 27).

*θ Vemation fasciculate, qenerally caespitose.

D. sagittifolia (Raddi) (v v. >3 D. lonchophora (Meu. );
D. pedam (Mun. ) (v v.;) D. palmata (Wizzd.) (v v. >; D.
collina (Raddi) (v v.) ; D. ornithopus (Mett.) 3 D. decipiens
(Hook.) ; D. decora (Bracke‘n. Fit„ t. 13).

The two latter are nativos of the Sandwich IslandS‚ the
‘others are almost confined bo Brazil.

164.—PE1.1.AEoPsxs, J. Sm.
Pellaea sp„ Hook. Sp. Fil.

Vernation fasciculabe, sub-caespitose. Fronds 6 to 18
inches or more in length, pinnato or bi. sub· tri. pinnam, firm,
amoni-h, casfiania-ebeneu53 pinnae and pinnules sessile, arti-
culate with the rachiS. Veins anastomosing. Receptacles
transverse, marginal, forming a. continuone sorus· Indusium
narrow. -

Type. Pteria articulata, Kaulf.

Ome—The two species which constitute this genua, agree
in general habit with Pellam, but differ in having reticulate
venation, which brings them in affinity with DoryopteriS,
