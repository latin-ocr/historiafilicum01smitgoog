OBS.—This genus consists of one species only, naizive of
J ava, Assam, and Moulmein. In general habit it resembles
some of the mulfifid speeies of Lastrea and Polystiolmm.
Its complete globoso cup indusium is similar to iahe seotion
Physematium of Woodsia, as also to the following genus
Peramma, differing only in the sori not being pedioellate3
this, however, is more apparent than real, sor in reality
there is a slightly elevated point in Diacalpe, off which the
entire sorus can be freely removed without rupturing the
indusium or disturbing ibs sporangia.
