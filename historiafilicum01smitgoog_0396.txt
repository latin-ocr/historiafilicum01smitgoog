states of its fronds in different regions, some of which may

allied Ferus.

The species are widely distributed, being found in India,
Malay‚ and islauds of the Pacific, A. Brownii extend-
ing to Southern Australis, A. umbrosum and A. axillam
being found in Madeira. In this country, especially in
Yorkshire‚ a number of what are called tasselled forms of
A. Fssioe-foemina are found, which have become great fa-
