ing· oblique elongated areoles, transversely combined by an
elongabed receptacle on both margins. Sori linear, con-

OBS.--The cenfiral costa, and reticulated vernation, dis-
tinguishes this from Lindseoe‚ and the sori being produced
on bot-,h margins from Synapmebium.

Brackenridge has characterised a genus which he calls
Dionia, of which he describes three species, the principa]
difference being in 15110 sori being slightly within 15110 mar·-
gin, and which is 11015 altered in texture, and therefore can
scarcely be called an indusium3 it- also differs in' 15110 sori
being in short pieces, 11015 continuone, which is consequent
on the pinnoe being· laciniated. '.Phe technical difference
seems 150 1110 to be scarcely sufficient to warrant ite adoplzion
as 8. genus.

OBS.—The fronds of 151115 species vary from simply pin-
nate, with entire lanceolate pinnae, 6 or more inches in
length, 150 bipinnate‚ with short, oblong, oblique pinnule5‚
in which the venation is occasionally free.
