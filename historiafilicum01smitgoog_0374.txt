OBS.—A solitary species constitutos this genus, the
affinity to which is difficult to determine. 'I'he stout
Zamiaplike caudex, squamoso vernation, and pinnato, rigid
fronds indicate a relationship in natural affinity with
Lomaria Boryana and Sadleria cyatheoidee, but its being
destitute of an indusium and the anastomose venation of
its sterile fronds‚ distinguishes it from these genera„ In
the ‘⁶ Species Filicum ’² it is placed next to Gymnoqramme‚
which includes species with both free and anastomose
venatiom and if the lines of sporangia of Brainea are
viewed as simple sori, it has therefore as good a claim to
be placed in Gymnoqramme as many other species placed in
that genus, as characterised in the “ Species Filicum.”

On taking all points into consideration, and the circum-
stance of a cultivated plant of Brainea at Kew having
produced a bipinnatifid or almost bipinnate frond, proves
that the more usual simple pinnate state is not the normal
condition of development, and such gives it more of an
affinity with Sadleria. It is found in two localitieS, namely,
Hong Kong‚ Khzisya in Bastern Bengal.
