duerffied ὥς· &ofin-sttimm To avoid this Ι have as far as
possible followed the plan adopted in my “ Arrangement
of Ferns‚” in 1841, where I have said that “ The authority
for the specific names being in a parenthesis denotes that
such species stood formerly under one or other of the
genera given as synonyms.''

I have to add that on account of the gradual failure oi
my sight I -have not been able to determine the position of
’ certain species. I therefore direct the special attention of
those who adopt my mode of classification‚ to the mass
of species included under the section Eupolypodimm of the
“ Species Filicum,” of which the author says the stipes are
“ articulated upon the caudex, as appears to be all of this
group,’' of which there are 151 described. I have, how-
ever, failed to identify more than fifty of the species as
having articulate vernation, and which 1 place under Poly-
podium as restricted by me, and as far as I have been able
to determine the many species represented by P. trichoma-
naides, P. monilzforme, and P. pewviana, have adherent
vernation‚ and which I refer to the genus Otenopteris in
Desmobrya. Ι also direct special attention to the arboroid
species of Pheqopteria Lastrea, Goniop teria, and Nephrodium‚
which, on account of their special habit, and the pinnae
being articulate with the rachis appears to me of sufficient
importance to warrant their separation from the more
humble species of their respective genera.

The extensive genus Elaphoqlossum also presente great
differenoe in the nature of its vernation‚ which appears to
be of sufficient importance to justify the species being·
arranged in separate generic groups.

I conclude my general observations on the classification
of Ferns by saying that my views, like those of other
writers, are open to criticism. If the critice have studied
