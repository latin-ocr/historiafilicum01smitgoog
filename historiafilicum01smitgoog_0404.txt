Ome-This genus is founded on a solitary species, which
in habit, and the nature of its fructification, is so peculiar
that it has given rise to much diversity of opinion as to its
proper place in any arrangement, whether natural or arti-
ficial. In my “ Genera of Ferns'' (1841) Ι stated that its
unilateral sporangia indicated it to belong to Aspleneae‚ and
that the imperfect or obsoleto indusium was owing to the
suppression of that organ, caused by the density of the
squamae on the under side of the frond. More recent
observations have shown the presence of a narrow linear
indusium, which is more evident in the large fronded
species called G. aurea, of Madeira‚ than in the common
form. It must, however, be confessed that its peculiarities
prevent its association with any species of the asplenoid
tribe, except with Asplenium. alternans of Wallich, already
noticed. In the “ Species Filicum '' it is placed in the
