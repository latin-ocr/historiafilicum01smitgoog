venation and position of the sori is variable, but in all

which is principally due to the more or less contracted
state of the fronde, and which has led Presl to place the
same species under different genera. The only very
evident distinction is in habit, which admits of their being
arranged under two sections, one having an elongated
caudex, and the other with contiguous caespitose fronds.
