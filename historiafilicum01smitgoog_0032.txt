(rachzfomn)‚ in others they are involute, in the form of a
pod or siliqua (siliquiform); in others plain, the under
snrface being densely occupied with sporangia3 in some,
the lower portion of the frond is sterile, while the upper
portion is contracted and fertile.

The duration of fronds is variable, some remaining per-
manent for several years, but the greater majority, espe-
cially those in temperate and cold climateS, develope and
come to maturity in one year.

It is, however, otherwise with the genera Gleiohenia, 141190-
dium, and Salpiohlaena ,· in the first the fronds are diaho-
tomou33 and from the axis of the forks are successively
produced other dichotomous branches‚ and the fronds thus
continue long permanent.

As regards Dyyoclium‚ the fronds so called continue to
lengthen and branch (indefinite), rambling over bushes or
climbing the tops of lofty trees 3 such is also the case with
the blechnoid Fern Salpichlaena. The permanent nature
of these climbing fronds (P) may be considered¹ analogous
to climbing fiowering planta such as Clemati83 to these
peculiar growing Ferns Ι apply the term Pterampelids.

VENATION.

The vascular structure of Ferns consiste of cords of
indurated tissue termed scalarzform, which branches from
the base of the previous frond into the nascent bud of the
forthcoming frond, and lengthen upwards withthe growth
of the frond. It consists of one, two, or more cylindrical,
flat, or channeled cords, which, on reaching the leafy part
of the frond, divide and ramify through all its partS, the nl-
timate ramifications ending in the loafy part (lamina), being
