instance, in O. arborea and 0. serra, the fronds are terminal,
forming the characteristic corona common to trec Ferns.
When mature they separate from the stem, leaving a clean
scar similar to Eremobrya‚ thus differing from the adherent
vernation characteristic of the mass of the species of the
tribe Gyathea; but as they agree in all the essentia]
characters as regards the nature of their fronds and fructi-
fication, it is therefore necessary to obtain more evidence
as to the mode of evolution and structure of these tree
Ferns before any satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at,
as to enable us to view it as a special character to mark
distinct general*

This now leads me to notice another family of Ferus
-namely, Marattiaceae, which have a vet-y distinct and
special habit from other Ferus, and are well marked by the
sporangia being destitute of a ring. The evolution of the
{rond is terminal and articulate to the caudex, as in Gyathew
arborea above noticed‚ but differs in the fronds rising
from between two stipuliform appendages in the form of
a socket‚ analogous to the stipules of phaenogamous plants.
The speciality of this group of Ferus leads me to view it
as constituting a distinct division, which I have named
Scaphobrya.

This division comprehende but a small number of species
as compared with Eremobrya and Desmobrya, the number
probably not exceeding thirty or forty, the principal part
of which are included under the genera Mai-attia, Angri-v
opteris and Danaa.

and Formation of the Stems of the ΤΙ-οε, Ferns of India‚” has been
published in the thirtieth volume of the Transactions of the Linnean
society, 1874, by Mr. J. Soott, Curator of the Botanic Gai-dene,
