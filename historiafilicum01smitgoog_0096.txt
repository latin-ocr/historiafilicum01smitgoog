gardan and herbarium collectione of Ferus as zealously
as I have done, whether their criticisms be favourable or
unfavourable to my views as regards the genera of Ferus,
it is hoped that their observatione will, as Sir william
Hooker said, be the means of throwing ‘⁴ a new light on
the shudy of Ferus, a light which cannot fail to aid the

researches of future writers?
