‘⁴ the finest in cultivation‚’' it in 1864 consisted of nearly
one-half of the number of the species described by him in
that work, but of these the learned author made less use
than might have been expected. This was consequent on
finding a considerable difference in describing species from
living plants and herbarium specimens ; for in many cases
it was found that it was not till specimens of the cultivated
plants were dried that they could be identified with native
specimens of the‘ same supposed species in the herbarium ;
consequently the descriptions in the “ Species Filicum ’⁹
are, with few exceptions‚ entirely founded on specimens in
the author’s herbarium.

With me it was otherwise: the living coUection re·
quiring daily care and attention, led me to become
acquainted with the special habits and modes of growth of
the different species 3 and this has enabled me draw up the
following natural arrangement. I say natural, but it must
be understood that any sequence of allied genera has its
limit, and that it is only in individua tribes that genera,
in most caseS, can be so arranged as to form natural
transitions from one to another. By this several tribes
become naturally connected, while others, such as Asplem'eoe,
Hymenophylleae, and Gleichenieoe, may be called independent
tribes. ,

The principle of the following arrangement is based on
the different modes of vernation and habit. It begins
with the division Eremobrya‚ followed by Desmobrya and

Scaphobrya ; each of these divisions are divided into tribes, ’

of which there are twenty-nine in all; each tribe contains
a greater or lesser number of genera, and the genera of
each tribe when possessing any well marked differential
characters are arranged under sections. The characters of
each genus are given, beginning with the nature of the
