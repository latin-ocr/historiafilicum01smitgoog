OBse-›As already stated, the only character that dis.
tinguishes thie genus from Blechnum is in the fertile fronde
being contracbed. In the “ Species ffificum,” Sir William
Hooker sayn, ‘⁴ a more careful invesssigation of several species
of Lomaria shows that they gradually depart from their
pteroid character, and completely merge into Bleckneoe.”

The genus consiste of between thirty and fort-‚y known
species, and as in Bleclmwm, the synonym of the species is
coni-’using ; they are widely distributed throughout the
hropical and temperate regions of bothhemisphereS‚ extend-
ing from the latitudo of New Zealand in che South to the
limite of Fern. life in the Norlzh, where the genus is repre-
sented by the well-known Loman‘a ιφίοαπτ, becher known
in this country as Bzoahnum boreale, of which, of late years,
numerous abnormal forme have been discovered, consisting
in sshe fronde being distorssed in various waye; some of these
are so unlike the typical form, thau without being acquainted
with their origin they would by some pterodologists be
considered ae bypes of diehinct speciest, thirty-six of these
forms are recorded in ΜΓ. Stansfield's catalogue.
