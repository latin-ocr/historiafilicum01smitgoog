Ona—I have above shown that the only technical
difference between HyvnmophyZWm and T richomanes is that
in the latter the receptacle is prolonged beyond the spo·
raugia, even in some to the length of a quarter of an inch,
having the appearance of bristles excerted beyond the
margin of the frond.

In this country Hymcnophyllaceoe is represented by three
specieS, namely‚ Hymenophylbum Tunbridqeme, H. andater-ale,
and Trichomanes melicano. They are, however, very rare,
being found in a few special localities; the latter is becoming
very rare in England, but is found in several localities in the
south of Ireland. Since the invention of Wardian casea,
these ‘⁴ Filmy Ferns ’' so called, have become great favourites
with amateur cultivators; and the great demand for 'them
is bringing about their extermination in this country.

With regard to Exotic specieS, in my “Cata-logne of

⁸ cultivated Ferns ’' for 1846, only two species are enume-

rated‚ which in 1864 had increased to sixty-three, as
recorded in “ FernS, British and Foreign,” pages 249 and
324.
