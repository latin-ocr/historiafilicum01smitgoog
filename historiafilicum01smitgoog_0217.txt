anastomose‚ but agrees in the sporangia being seated in a
marginal groove. The upper of these is the largest, repre-
senting an indusium analogous to that of Ικὶπεῑεωα, with
which it is associated in the “ Species Filicum,’' but its
very different habit prevents its being associated with
Isindsaea. It is otherwise peculiar in being the only Fern
in Desmobrya having transverse marginal sori, and com-

· pound anastomosing venation.

Tribe 11.-PLEUROGRAMMEAE (Plate 11).

Fronde simple, 1 to 10 and 12 inches in length, entire,
serrato, rarely dentate or laciniated. Scri linear, transverse
costal, or oblong sub-linear, oblique.

OBS.—'I'his tribe contains about thirty small, and with
the exception of a few, grass-like Ferus, and although the
character of the sori does not technically differ from
Gymnoqramme, they nevertheless are so different in habit
that they do not form a natural connection with that
genus3 I therefore deem it best to characterise them as a
distinct tribe.

83.-M0N0GRAMMA, Schk. (1809).

Verhation uniserial‚ sarmentum slender. Fronde simple,
distant, linear, graminoid, 1 to 4. inches high. Veinless.
Costa sporangiserous on its disk, or seated in a deep groove
on one or both sides, forming a continuous or interrupted
linear soris near the apex of the fronds, the margins of
which are generally more or less incurved.

Type. Monoqramma qraminea, Sohk.
