heads, which bear the name of the leading genus of each,
and adopts the different modes of venation and character of
the 6611 66 9611 of his genet-ic character, bnt 116 introduces
new elements in characterising 1116 genera, such as giving
the form and structure of the sporangia, and the number
of articulations cf the ring, also the different form of

their value, I candidly confess that ' in 611 my observations
and experiences I have failed to satissy myself that either
the number of articulations of the ring, or the form of the
speres, - can in any way be practically serviceable for
. defining either genera or species. The little value of such
characters become obvious 611 comparing his descriptions
of individual 6966166 with their respective generic cha„
racters, for example, in 15116 generic character of Aspidium
the number of articulations of the ring 16 stated to be
18-20, that 16, 611 1116 6966166 of Aspidium should 1161 have
less 61 111616 111611 the above number3 but 111 1611 of 1116
new species of Aspidiuna he describes the number of
articulations as much below the number assigned in the
character of the genus3 hence, these 6966166 according to
his own descriptions, should not be placed in Aspidium.
As far as regards the characters derived from the speres,
Ι 6111 6611611116 that their forms are various and in some
cases peculiar3 but the 696166 of Ferns, like the seeds of
other plants, will, if gathered before they are mature,

appear to the microscopic observor to be normal, and

figures of such appearances are consequently drawn and
published. In my opinion much examination is still re-
quired, before either the structure of the sporangium or
