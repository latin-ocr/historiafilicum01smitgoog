part of the preceding being derived from living plants of
theKew collection. The practical use of these works is
in assisting to determine species, and which, either under
the same name or as synonyme, will be found in his last and
great work the “ Species Filicum,” the most important
systematic work on Ferns yet published, being a description
of all known Ferns, particularly of such as exist in the
author’s herbarium (previously noticed), and such as are
with sufficient accuracy described and figured in the works
of other authors, It consiste of five volumes, the first of
which appeared in 1846, and the fifth in 1864, its* prepara-
tion having occupied his leisure time for a period of not
less than twenty years. It treats of the orders G'leichmzi-
aceae and Polypodiaceae only, of which 2,401 species are
described, with their synonyms, which amount to about
4‚300, as also their native countries and names of collectore,

arranges the whole under sixty-three genera, fourteen
of which contain ·only one species each, thus present.

continues to retain under the characters assigned by Lin-

Pteris, and Acrostichum, thus avowing his preference for
large genera by strictly adopting the characters derived
solely from the fructifica-tion. With reg-ard to which he

his conviction that those botanists who have shown them.
solves peculiarly addicted to multiplying genera have not
always taken nature as their guide, nor succeeded in
eliciting a simple nor tangible arrangement, yet have their
close and accurate investigations thrown a new light on the
study of Ferns, a light which cannot fail to aid the re·-
