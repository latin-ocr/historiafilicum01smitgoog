OBS.—-The only representative of this genus is a native
of Ecuador and QuibO, observed by Dr. J ameson and Spruce,
from whom Sir Wm. Hooker received specimens‚ and
I possessed a specimen of it collected by Hartweg. In
general appearance it resembles narrow fronds of Plewri-
dium crassifolium, with' which it also agrees in the sori
being· large and in an oblique row between the primax-y
ν61116, but differs in the under side being densely stellated
tomenbose‚ as in Niplzobolus, but from which it differs in
having oblique nniserial sori, which also distinguishes it
from Niphopst'a
