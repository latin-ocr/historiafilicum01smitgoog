ΟΒΒ.--Οεῑοπίοῐοπ1α having punctiform marginal sori
similar to that of Davallia, has led the species to be placed
by most authors in that genus, but the eccentric costa
clearly shows its affinity to be with Ηπᾶεωα, with which it
also agrees in habit, only separated by the sori being
punctiform, not linear and continuone as in true Lindsaea.
¹ 'Phe genus consists of about half a dozen known species,
they are widely distributed in or near the tropics, being
represented in Guiana, the Mauritius, Malayan, Fiji, Sand-
wioh, Philippine, and Polynesian Islands.

OBS.—Od0ntol0ma repens affords a good example of the
different views entertained by Pteridologists in defining
the technical character of genera on the sori alone; this
species is epiphytal, having a slender sarmentum and linear
pinnate fronde, a foot or more in length, -with dimediate
