⁴ ons—This genus consists of about thirty or forty known
species of slender fronded Ferus, widely spread through
the tropice and sub-tropical regions of both hemispheres.
They vary considerably in size and the divisione of the
froude, as also in the indusium being of various forms,
which in some cases might be considered sufficient to be of
generic value‚ but as it osten varies in form in the same
species it cannot be viewed as of more than specific value.
In some it is a distinct, round, inflexed crenule, containing
on its axis a single receptacle, in others it is oblong‚ or
more or less elongated, containing two or more receptacles,
in some it is straight, in others it is crenulated and wavy.
These differeuces admit of the species being arranged in
groups as follows 2—-
