microscopic spores can be made available as auxiliary cha-
racters, and this will require the labonr of years ; and even
when complete, will be of but little service either to the
student or general observer 3 for Ι am satisfied that, with
our present knowledge of the more obvious outward
features that distinguish Ferns from one another, these in·-
teresting plants can be readily arranged in groups forming
natural genera and alliances‚ without requiring much aid
from the microscopist.

Besides the additional characters derived from the struc-
ture of the sporangia, both Presl and Fee attach much im-·
portance to the difference in the number and forms of the
bundles or plates of vascular fibre in the stipes. My
observatione upon that point tend to show, that, although
the bundles are generally uniform in simple fronded spe-
cies, yet in many others the number and form appear to
vary according to the frond being more or less compoun'd
and varying in size‚ age, and vigour of growth of indi.
vidual plants of the same species. In the stipes of a full-
sized frond (ten feet in length) of Gyatlaea arborea, Ι found
thirty-six vascular bundles in the stipes below the lowest
pair of pinnae, and this number nearly corresponded with
the number of pinnae forming the frond ; in fronds of in-
termediate sizes the bundles were fewer, apparently formed
suited to the more or less compound development of the
frond consequent on the size and age of the plant3 for
instance, in fronds of the same species, a foot in length
with few pinnae has only three broad vascular platea in
the stipes. It is reasonable to suppose that the shape or
outward form assumed by every species is based upon a
vascular frama-work, developed according to some definite
plan inherent to each individual species, but varying
according to the circumstances that influence the growth
