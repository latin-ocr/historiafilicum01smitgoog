. ‘Although they agree in general habit they have never-
theless been arranged by different authors under no less
than at least six genera, the technical characters being
chiefly derived from slight differences in the venation and
position of the sori—for instance, Sayenia is character-ised
by Presl as having no free veinlets, but I find th'at that
character is not constant, for in different specimens of the
same species some have the venation of Saqenia, and others
have free veinlets as in Aspidium‚ and sometimes the two
forms are found on the same frond3 the characters of -the
other genera of authors are also, I consider, untenable.
Ι therefore retain them under Aspidium.

It often happens that the indusium is soon deciduous,
Ἴ and therefore when absent this genus cannot be distin-
guished from Dictyopteris and Dryomenes,· also in some
species, as for instance the well-known Aspidium macro-
phylfflm, the indusium is as often reniform as peitate. This
difference has ‘led the author of the “ Synopsis Filicum ”
to consider the renisorm as the normal form, and accord-
ingly places A. macrophylbum and other allied species
in the genus Nephrodium, from which they differ entirely
in habit.

In the “Gartenflora,” 1866, page 335, Dr. Regel had
characterised a new genus under the name of Gramma-
tosorws, which is accompanied by a figure. It, however,
appears to me to be founded on what may be termed an
amorphous form of the sori of Aspidium alatum of Wallich,
a large-growing Indian species, bearing numerous irregular
sniall sori, which in specimens from Malacca are irregulan
and confluent, forming linear transverse sori analogous to
Memmium, while others on the same segment form linear
sori parallel with the primary veins. The same variableness
n the form of the sori is also to be found in A. irreyuum
