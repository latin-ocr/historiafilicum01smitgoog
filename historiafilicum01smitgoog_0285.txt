slender prolonging epigeous sarmentum. In habit they
agree with the section Pheqopteris‚ but are technically
distinguished by the sori being terminal, and produced in
the axis of reflexed crenules or lobules of the incised mar-
gin of the frond, in that respect analogous to the pteroid

¹ ‚genus OheilantheS, but the apparent indusium has no dis-

tinct axis of attachment, being merely a reflexed changed
crenule‚ also the habit of the species which I restrict to
szpolepis are widely distinct from those of true CheilantlzeS.
In some cases the inflexed crenule is not very evident‚ and
it is then difficult to distinguish the species from PheqopteriS,
for instance such species as P. ornata, which by some
authors is referred to Hypolepis.

In Hooker’s ‘⁶ Species Filicum ” 30 species are described,
which in the Synopsis are reduced to 11. The following
are the most well defined species. They are widely dis-
tributed, being found in the tropice, and extending to
the latitude of N ew Zealand in the South and Japan in the
North.
