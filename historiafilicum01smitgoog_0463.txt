regions3 while Ompyzomwron, thebocuum, G‘om'ophlebium,
and Polypodimn, are, with a few exceptione, natives of the
Western.

It is very remarkable that genera with single species,
such as Mato‘nia, Per-anema, Loxoma, Dictyoxiphium, and
Trichiocarpa are found only in very limited areas3 while,
on the other hand, two Ferns of special habit, Didymoohzaena
truncatula and Oleandra mrizfformis, are found in the tropical
regions of both hemispheres. The small Island of St.
Helena contains 25 species, of which 13 have been found
nowhere else.

Besides the above conclusione arrived at by Mr. Baker,
another view of the number of species found in different
countries is derived from local ‘⁴ Floras ” and ‘⁶ Catalogues‚'’
of which the following are the principal; it must, however,
be understood that many of the species found in one

country are also common to other countries 2-
