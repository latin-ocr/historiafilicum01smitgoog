described, but according to my view, I consider there are
tvm, natives of Malayan and other Eastern islands.

OBse-This genus is founded on a remarkable Foru, a
native of J amaica aud Guba. In habit it does not well
associate with any of the Aspideae group, except Polyetiohwm
rhizophyllum, with which it agrees in the sterile fronde,
being· decumbent and proliferous ς in that character as also
in the texture and eolour of the sronds, and in the oblong,
apparent double indusium, seems to indicate a greater
relationship with Antiqramma in the tribe Asplemleae, rather
than with any of the genera of the present sequence.
