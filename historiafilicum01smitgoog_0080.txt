under one specific name. For instance, under Polypodium
lycopodioides there are no less than twenty-two synonyma
and under P. &asiliensis eighteen. These examples are
additional proof of what has already been said of the
confusion of the nomenclatore of Ferns, brought about by
the different views of Pteridologists.

I conclude this part by noticing a memoir, published in
1866, by J. Ε. Bommer,Secreta1-y of the Royal Botanic
Society of Brussels,dn the bulletin of the Royal Society of
Belgium, vol. 5, No. 3, 1866, entitled “ Monographie de la
Classe des Fougeres,’' being a review of the writings on
Ferns by different authors, beginning with Bernhardi,
1799. He gives an abstract of the classification of the
principal authors, but as nothing specially new is brought
forward above what is noticed in the preceding pages,
it is not necessary to enter into details ε he concludes
by giving an arrangement of his own which also presents
nothing new.

The memoir is accompanied by six finely executed
plates ς the first shows the different forms of the sporangia
and synangia ; the other five plates contain portions of the
fronds, illustrating the character of forty- one genera.

Abstract showing the number of genera of the preceding
authors. ·--
