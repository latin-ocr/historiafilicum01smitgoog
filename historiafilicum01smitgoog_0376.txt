Ona—This is a well marked genus which in the “ Species
Filicum '' is represented by six species, three of which VI,
however, exclude from true Woodwardia, as I consider them
sufficiently distinct to verrant their adoption under the
two following genera.

The species here restricted to Woodwardia are remark.-
able for producing numerous viviparous buds, which reedily
become plante.

Sp. W. redicens, Sm. (v V.) 3 W. orientalis, Sw. (v v.);
W. Japonica, Sw. (v v.).

The two latter species are nativos of China and J apan ;
the first is found in the South of Europe, Madeira, Azore8‚
J ava, Μοκίοο, California, Gnatemala, and Norbhern India. ·
